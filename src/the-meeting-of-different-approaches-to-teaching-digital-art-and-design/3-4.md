Becoming an artist or a designer in a digital society that changes constantly requires the ability to adapt, but also some keys to understand it. How to create in a world so strongly shaped by humans? How can we reinvent – or preserve – practices and tools that enhance the future rather than darken it? How can we create at the speed of digital world while maintaining the necessary critical distance? How and what can we transmit in a constant flux of new things and stimulations? These are core questions for many creative higher schools, and openschool.art provided an opportunity to share them by bringing together various art schools and universities.

On the 10 and 11 of May 2022, we were around fifty teachers and students from french art and design schools, gathered in Esadse's auditorium to talk about the issues at stake in teaching digital creative practices.

#### Questions we discussed together:
- Are digital practices in art schools a game changer for the  real world?
- Can we teach digital practices without environmental awareness?
- What is the common ground for a shared digital culture? ou What are the  basis of a common digital culture?
- What are the good digital practices to share with art and design students?
- Should we teach tools AND design? ou Does digital design education go hand in hand with teaching tools?
- Can we be a digital artist without knowing computer programming? ou Can a digital artist be ignorant of computer programming?
- Is digital art history a needed knowledge for a contemporary artist?
- Does the status "digital artist" make sense? ou Is it meaningful to claim to be a "digital artist"?
- Does the status "digital designer" make sense? ou Is it meaningful to claim to be a "digital designer"?
- Does digital design involve a particular ethic?
- In our digital society, should computer programming be a skill of the contemporary designer or artist's toolbox?
- Does digital design facilitate incluive design?
- Should a digital artist or designer be self-reliant for technical knowledge?
- Should a digital designer be able to design algorithms?
- Should hacking be included in digital design education?
- Is integrating digital into a project an ideological act?
- Is peer-to-peer learning the most effective way to master digital tools?
- Can digital design training be delegated (ou outsourced) to tutorials?
- Is there a minimal technical base, common to all digital creation?
- Should art and design schools train computer programming artists or equipped creative individuals?
- How does digital transforms drawing and volume teachings?
- Regarding art and design schools, should we value computer programming or should we rather privilege "no code" environments?
- Does using software or digital production tools (laser cutting, 3D printer...) in a work make it be a digital project?
- Can we make digital do-it-yourself practices fit into the pedagogy of art and design schools?
- What position should video games have in art and design education?
- How can we value collaborative and cooperative practices within digital design?
- Are there any specificities related to digital creation?
- What is the position of industry-derived vocabulary inside creative digital practices?
- Is metaverse a place for creation?
- Should we train artists and designers to metaverse?
- Should digital culture and practices be connected to social struggles? Are they naturaly linked together?
- As new business models for creation, should NFTs be included in pedagogy within art and design schools?
- Is it possible to be original and creative using proprietary software (Adobe, Microsoft...)?
- Does teaching proprietary software (Adobe, Microsoft...) in creative schools produce creators or consumers?
- Does promoting a specific "digital writing" in art and design make sense?
- Is artificial intelligence a tool to be taught in the creative field?
- Who is the author when a work is created autonomously by an algorithm?

### openschool.art in *Le Monde Sinon Rien* exhibition
#### Biennale Internationale Design Saint-Etienne 2022
Since our event took place at the same time as the BID Saint-Étienne, we had the opportunity to exhibit openschool.art inside the *Le monde, sinon rien (The world or nothing)* exhibition figuring projects from students and young researchers from five French art and design institutions.

The *Le monde, sinon rien (The world or nothing)* exhibition was a veritable apparatus for experimentation open to public participation. On entering the exhibition, the visitor finds a huge map covering the floor representing a field of exploration, the one that teachers in art and design schools offer their students every year and which they roam, document and transform.

**Curators:** Sophie Pène (lecturer-researcher at Learning Planet Institute) and Benjamin Graindorge (designer and lecturer at Esadse).

A space was dedicated to openschool.art within the exhibition and the [website](https://lemondesinonrien.fr/carte/projet/openschool.art).

We decided to show the questions that we discussed during the professionnal meetings, besides videos inspired by those questions and produced by some of the participating schools. Videos and displays were added as things were processing during the whole time of the Biennale.

The latest Openschool session took place in Issy-les-Moulineaux, hosted by Ensad. This was an open forum for discussion between digital educators at French art schools (and universities), to tackle a wide range of issues. 

Four main themes were worked on for this session:
- What AI is doing to art and to schools? 
- How to get out of Adobe? What common tools for schools – or how can we share our resources and documentation? 
- Thinking about digital tools through collective practice.

One question remains unanswered: The role of students needs to be reconsidered. From this point of view, a strong proposal would be to pool the financial resources dedicated to the event to enable the presence of students with different profiles and backgrounds as this is the only way to guarantee the presence of a diversity of thoughts and practices around the table.
