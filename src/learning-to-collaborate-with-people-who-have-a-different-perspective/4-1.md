## Cooperative Games: Play Together, Esadse's workshop,  11-15 April 2021, Saint-Étienne (FR)

In connection with the problematic of the Digital Tools for Creative Collaboration project, the purpose of the workshop is to experiment collaborative work's situations to understand the fundamental principles of a collaborative relation. Regarding the difficulties we encountered during the first workshopin EKA to bring together our different visions of design and our methodologies, we thought that games as a common cultural object would be a suitable starting point.

### Subject and goals of the workshop

Considering that games (board games, video games, sports games, etc.) request mechanisms that are part of various forms of collaboration, we proposed to focus the workshop on the idea of playing together.

Many games are based on competition, few of them are based on collaboration and cooperation and allow us to win together rather than play against each other.

During the workshop, we proposed two principles : 
- we design games together (in small groups) 
- we elaborate rules that requires to collaborate in order to win

Esadse's Resources were available in this objective (laser cutting, 3d printing, VR headset, etc.) in order to produce prototypes that could be played the last day.

### Talk: Notions about cooperative games

As an introduction to the workshop, David-Olivier Lartigaud talked about cooperative games, based on the book by **Katie Salen Tekinbaş and Eric Zimmerman, *Rules of Play : Game Design Fundamentals* (MIT Press, 2003)** and other references specified in the text.

#### Conditions for a game to exist

- Every game exists within a frame: a specially demarcated time and space. The frame communicates to players, consciously or unconsciously, that a game is being played.
- The magic circle of a game (Johan Huizinga, Homo Ludens, 1938) is the space within which a game takes place. Whereas more informal forms of play do not have a distinct boundary, the formalized nature of games makes the magic circle explicit.
- Within the magic circle, the game's rules create a special set of meanings for the players of a game. These meanings guide the play of the game.
- As a system, a game can be considered to have an open or closed relationship to its context. Considered as RULES, a game is closed. Considered as PLAY, a game is both open and closed. Considered as CULTURE, a game is open.
- The lusory attitude is the state of mind required to enter into the play of a game. To play a game, a group of players accepts the limitations of the rules because of the pleasure a game can afford.

Rules constitute the inner, formal structure of games. All games have rules, and rules are one of the defining qualities of games.

- Rules limit player action
- Rules are explicit and unambiguous
- Rules are shared by all players
- Rules are fixed
- Rules are binding
- Rules are repeatable

**Although some games question and violate these characteristics, these are the common traits of game rules considered from a strictly formal point of view.**

#### Games as systems of conflict

- How many players can play?
- Do they play simultaneously or do they alternate playing the game?
- Is there a high score list?
- Are players given constant feedback about their relative scores?
- Does the game pause to allow players to directly compare their scores and other game statistics?
- Are there computer-generated opponents and obstacles that players face together or do the players serve as opponents for each other?
- Does the structure of the game allow players to have direct conflict with each other?
- Are there resources for which players can compete?
- Can players spend money to continue the game or enhance their play?

Coopetition or co-opetition (sometimes spelled "coopertition" or "co-opertition") is a neologism coined to describe cooperative competition. Coopetition is a portmanteau of cooperation and competition. Basic principles of co-opetitive structures have been described in game theory ("Coopetition," in Wikipedia).

### Talk: How to make a collaborative game?

Mathias Hû (Esadse student) presented is incompleted brand game projet: Run-off, to introduce the issues at stake and difficulties in making a collaborative game.

- When you start to have more than one player in a game, you have to think about how they interact between themselves. 
- The most common way is **competitive** relation. All players are in competition to win. It can be for a fight like in Street Fighter, for a conquete of teritory like in Risk or for the first place of a classement like in Mario Kart.
- You can also group the players in different **teams**. The motor of the game still the competition but it create cooperatives relations inside each team. It's the case for team sport like basket-ball, for Overwatch or brand games like Time's Up.

Finally, if you want to create a game based only on cooperation without competitive aspect between players you have to find a new motivation to play for your players. In fact, competition it's very use because it's a very easy way to invite people to play and to keep them implication in the game. This is the beginning of a list of alternatives for the "motor" of cooperatives games :

- The desire to **create** something together can be a sufficient motivation. It's the case for exemple in some minecraft servers or in construction games like Lego or Kapla (this two last should maybe classed more as toys but with the potential to create a game)
- In other case the **exploration** is use as a motor of implication for players. It's the case in narrative, linear or puzzle games. You want to continue collectivly because you want to discover the next step, next part of the story, next environnement... We can list Borforce or Portal 2 in coop mode as well as many Role Play Games.
- **The game can be too an opponent** for a collective team of all the players. In this case the game provides challenges and the team must cross all of them or the most possible to do a score.

All of this *motors* can be combined and many games use a combination of them.

#### Run-off

Run-off is a project of brand game incompleted. 
It's started with the intention to create a competitive game but where a non-cooperative strategy is radically unproductive for everyone. The players start to play against each others but create teams step by step and build collective strategies.

Each player manage one floor of tubes in a tower. The rain falls on the higher one an run-off on each floor until the ground. On the ground, each player have a vase and have to collect a maximum of water. Whitout collective coordination, all the water is wasted for everyone.

##### Difficulties and conclusions

The game was to complex and needed a very good capacity of spatial projection. Some rules unbalanced all the rule system. Those different aspects made the game unplayable.

This experience changed my way to approach the creation of a game. In my opinion it's important to start with a not too complex concept and to try to find in a first time, a balanced and playable situation before to add features. This balance is very weak so it's important to test the most possible at each changement of rules to check its preservation.

The use of metaphor or narrative is very usefull to introduce some rules of features because we are familiar with the concept that it presents. Then it's more easy to understand it and use it. In the case of Run-off, the concept of gravity allows to understand the "complex" movement of water that dosen't need to be explained to the players who are already familiar with it.

### Talk: Collective creation(s) based on a contributive model

Samantha Zannoni (Esadse Third Cycle student) shared her collective experiment of Olivier Auber's poïétique generator. This net artwork was designed and programmed in 1987, under the label free art.

Now developed in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript, everyone can connect to the webpage. There are a number of pixels available and people can draw simultaneously in their one strip. There is no winner or looser, the point is to create something together and see what's happening.

### Shared references: Video games

In some MMORPGs, it is necessary to be several people to send a dungeon or beat an enemy (Guild system). It is obviously inspired by the situations produced by RPGs around a table. The participants discuss to solve puzzles and defeat enemies.

Many sandbox games have cooperative or collaborative modes. GTA (robbing a bank together), Minecraft (building things together), etc.

But the gameplay of these games is not specific to cooperation. You can also do things alone.

Other games have specific gameplay that requires cooperation otherwise the game is impossible to finish or win. Here's some examples with short comments on the subject of collaboration:

#### It Takes Two / A way out

Two players must cooperate to complete tasks. It is the complementarity and coordination of actions that counts.

#### Overcooked

Working together to go fast. What is interesting is that everyone redistributes tasks according to the situation in order to be as efficient as possible.

#### Nvidia omniverse

Not a game but proceeds on the same principle. Everyone collaborates on a specific task to obtain a quick result.

#### Among Us

In this game, there're tasks to be done with a common goal (just a pretext), but the real goal is to find an imposter. Here's an interesting disruptive element, like a bad collaborator.
No synchronisation or coordination between actions necessarily. Everyone does their own thing until it is time to discuss for eliminating a player. It's a bit like some TV shows where several people in a loft vote to eliminate a roommate.
(In the case of Among US, which is map-based, it is easy to imagine an adaptation in the form of a board or a card game.)

#### Out of Space

It's a collocation game. You have to maintain a *space station*, avoid dirt, have food, etc.

#### Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes

Collaboration when the players are not at the same level of information.

#### Alternate Reality Games (ARG)

ARG have the power to create communities searching together to solve a riddle. The cooperation is act after the start of the game and not before as in many games. In this case, we can more speak about contribution that is a very specific type of cooperation.

#### Heave-Ho

This game is just very fun !! There is top the exploration of a collective movement create by the add of individuals movements.

#### A Way Out

A videogame created to be played in coop mode only.

#### Brothers : A Tale of Two Sons

This game offers you the possibility to control two characters with the same controller. It supposes to be played by only one person but you can easly with two. It creates a new relation with the controller, as an individual object, and a new position to play collectivly.

#### Medieval games

This game for four players is edited on Wii. The game simulates a brand game where every player is against the others. On each case all players will play a mini-game and the winner(s) win something in the global brand game. The mini-games created many collective structures: 1v1v1v1 ; 2v2 ; 1v3 ; 1v1 with two players that can help or hamper one player or the other. This dynamic create alliances and implicite teams between the players.

### Shared references : Board games

#### Mafia/The Werewolves of Millers Hollow

Two sides collaborate against each other based on silent exchanges.

#### 5-Minute Dungeon

A very simple cooperative game!

#### Legend of Andor

A very complicated cooperative game!

#### The Mind

Very simple board game. But you have to collaborate on a task without talking to each other. Interesting to ask yourself how to reach a goal with a strong constraint.

#### Mansion of madness - 2nd edition

The game master is a tablet. You have to follow the instructions to solve puzzles together and to fight enemies.

#### Cerberus

On this brand game, all players start as a survivor who has to escape the cerberus. You have to cooperate for that. But because everyon can be saved, you have to sacrify one by one players that join the cerberus's team and have to stop you.

#### Puzzles

It will be interesting to understand how puzzles, with the ultra simple principle, can create collective relations and monments.

#### Concept

This game is a "discribe and guess" game. You have to discribe a concept with combination of pictograms that present simple concepts. The fun point with this game is that it was created with competitive features but they look very unatural and can be easly be abandoned to only play in cooperative mode, for the fun.
