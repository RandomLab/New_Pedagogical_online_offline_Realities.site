## Cooperative games made by students

Throughout the week, students organized themselves into inter-school teams to develop game concepts.
We ended the week with a day of public opening and testing of the game prototypes. Students had the occasion to get immediate feedbacks from various types of public including children. It was also a great exercice for them to present their work to an audience also composed of people out of the art and design field.

#### Game concept

The concept of the game is that all participants have to reach the center or the number 0.
In order to move forward and reach your goal, there are challenges that need to be achieved.
The challenges have certain restricitions. If successfull, you get closer to the center.
Except you're not the one doing the challenges. It's everyone participating in the game that are doing the challenge for you. And you moving closer to the center depends on how well they succeed in the given challenge.

#### Your success depends on their success.

Think of it this way: Life throws you challenges and much restrictions come along. Many of them require your motivation but also the help of others. Sometimes you succeed and sometimes you don't. But you keep on trying. And that's life.

- A small story for this game
"You thought you were just going to play cards with your friends. But a strange murmur is charming you from the center of the decks.You want to know more. You're curious. You try to get closer, but a thin wall is stoping you reaching that voice. Walls in the form of circles. You cannot go through alone. One challenge is given to have the chance of hearing this charm of a voice and finding the answer to your curiosity. That requires help.
Bribes are in the way, the cards reveal a way for you to move closer and closer. But beware, those challenges hide glitches. You're bounded to the others. You cannot move with the others. Follow the voice, unite and find that murmur you're looking for."

#### Rules and restrictions of the game

The game is played by a minimum of five people.

- Each player will have a ticket that indicates their position.
- All players will begin at the same circle (depending on the number of players and rounds you'd like to play) but the minimum is 3.
- The youngest player gets the first call.
- You have two decks of cards, one deck that is the challenge given called "challenge" and the other that is restriction given for the challenge the player will do which is called "glitch".
- Shuffle each deck at every turn, then draw a card from each deck. You have to say what's the challenge and what's the restriction but you cannot participate in it. 
- Everyone on the same circle as the player calling the challenge, can choose to participate by raising their hand and getting around the caller.
- With each call, one should be devoted (a minimum of one player) and one should step aside. When the caller reveals the combination, a given time is set and the responders will have to coordinate to achieve the challenge together, as a scene.
- It's up to the player aside to decide if the challenge has been a success or not by raising their hand.
- If it's a success, the caller of the challenge moves to the next circle and chooses the next caller from the ones that have responded to their call.
- It the challenge was not a success, the next caller is chosen within the players that are aside.

When two people are alone in the same circle, they should go along with the same combination.
- In this case, each of them picks on other player, and the teams present their "answer" at the same time.
- The selected player goes on and chooses the next caller// or if it leaves a player behind the group (on the lower circle), everyone should join forces (even the caller) and "answer" the challenge for one to pass.
- The player keeps the call.

#### What was the process during the game design?

We started with a goal of what our game would be "competitive by cooperation".That way we can be guided by it when we're brainstorming and ideating. 
We started mentioning different ideas that could fall under the category such as Mario-Party, Fall guys, Simon says etc.

Followed by describing them and find what's common such as that everyone is equal and has equal chances.

It was a bits and pieces from all games that we could remember under the title "competitive by cooperation".

#### Iteration and Testing

For the iteration we relied on questioning every step or every rule we were putting. Moving forward with laying down the possible platform, we teared each idea apart by asking "what if". That got us to strip the unnecessary steps, rules and gap that the game might not need, in order to keep all players engaged with playing, progressing and enjoying the story.

The time we've put on building the idea has limited us from physically testing the game as it requires a full emergence in the game with a number of people for a time period beyond 5 or 10 minutes.

Our testing came into two parts, showing our printed cards to various people and we noticed their curiosity and excitement looking at the challenges and the restricition and seeing how they would imagine doing the challenge.

And then the second part was on exhibition day where we saw the actual immersiveness in the game.

### Spacimen

##### Sarah Hadjazi, Felix Häberle, Yareny Duriez

#### Game concept

Spacimen is a a game about surviving, which is why it is a collaborative and competitive game. 

Up to four participants will have limited time to shape a Spacimen (creature) based on a series of determined parameters of the given natural environment. 

This parameters are presented in format of statements and a story that allows the player to imagine and interprate the world. 

{% image "img_8634.jpg", "The board game during the last day for testing", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw" %}
<figcaption>The board game during the last day for testing </figcaption>

#### Rules of the game

- Mix the Worlds circular pieces and pile them up facing down. 
- Group the 4 Facts & Scene cards according to the environment they represent, and place them where they are accessible to all the players.
- Give equal pieces of clay to all the players. 
- The round starts at the moment one of the Worlds pieces is put in the centre of the board. 
- When the World is displayed, all the players must take the card that represents it , read the Facts & Scene and place it near to their sight. 
- Within 2 minutes, all players must build a Spacimen that will be able to survive in the given World, according to the Facts & Scene. 
- Each player must defend how & why their Spacimen is the ideal inhabitant for the given World. 
- All players must take notes, question & judge every Spacimen’s features regarding their possibility to survive according to the World’s description given in the Facts & Scene. 
- 1 point will be awarded to the best feature for each fact of the world.
- When everybody has defended their Spacimen and all the Facts have been revised, players must sum up their won points. 
- The player with the most points wins the round and the World. The player that doesn’t get any points loses the round and can’t play the next one. 
- The round for the next World may start. 

Semi Final & Final Trial:

When there is only one World left, all Spacimens must collaborate. 

Before the assessment of the 2nd to last World, all Spacimens must find a partner for the final round. 

The assessment proceeds regularly, but for the start of the final round they must work in pairs. One person models & one person directs. 

The one with more points in this round, wins. If there is a match, the one with more worlds takes the lead.

#### Restrictions of the game

- 2 minutes for shaping the Spacimen according to the environmnet
- Every fact represents a determined amount of points, that will tell who is the winner of the round. 
- The players must decide among each other who wins the points of evey environments and discuss on the why.

#### Iteration

The discussion of the rules was an ongoing process. We did a draft of the assumed rules, but definetely we had to try it out among ourselves and with others to actually understand the needed logic for the game to make sense and create a playful, yet collaborative & competitive environment as we has espablished our wish. 

{% image "img_0305.jpg", "Iteration for research purpose", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw" %}
<figcaption>Iteration for research purpose</figcaption>


#### Testing

Before printing or cutting the pieces of the game, we tested the game with the illustrations of the environments for testing the needed time for shaping the creatures, to test with external audience if the illustration made sense with the narrative facts and to also measure how fun would the challenge and assessing the results be!

#### End Result

The final result demostrated to be very fun for the audience. We saw smiles, laughs, debating, stress and engagement while playing, which succesfully portrays the kind of game we wanted to design, searching for surprises that stimulate imagination but also provide perspective and stretch the standard way of thinking of the participants. We wanted for thisgame to also foster communication between the participants, in a debate form for taking decisions, as we believe that this would be a very good example of how collaboation and competition can exist in the same world.

#### Progress

We are right now discussing on how to improve the rules and the logical adquisition of points so it creates less controversial and the decision are less subjective and better justifies according to the elements of the game and the stories that every described world tells.

<figcaption>Aela game elements </figcaption>

#### Game concept
Aela is a drawing game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and bring out their creativity.
It should be low effort to understand it and play it. You should be able to play it without a specific goal but fun. If you feel you played enough, you should be able to just stop playing.

#### Rules of the game

You need to be at least three people to play the game. Two people make a team and the others guess.

Then the team has to pick a keyword. Both have to roll the dice. The displayed restriction is the one you have to follow while drawing your keyword.

Now you have 30 seconds time.
The team has to collaborate without talking (just by drawing) to create a drawing that represents the keyword they just picked.

When the 30 seconds are over, the other players have to guess the keyword from both drawings.

To continue with the game, form a new team and start the next round.

Play as long as you have fun, there’s no winner or loser!

{% image "symbols.jpg", "the rules of the game", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw" %}
<figcaption>the rules of the game</figcaption>

#### Restrictions of the game

Each player is given a restriction in drawing by the dice.

They are also given a 30-second time limit for drawing and a restriction not to speak while drawing.

#### What was the process during the game design

We started with just brainstorming around keywords like: simple,body,random,collaborative
Afterwards we tried to connect different words and categories to combine them and form possible games out of it.
Then we came up with different contexts like: where should it be played and who should play it etc. 

#### Iteration and testing

First, we came up with the idea of combining the whispering game with drawing. We also made a paper dice to give players constraints such as "draw without looking". When we tested it, we found that the constraint idea worked but it's too easy to play and the waiting time was boring.
Next, based on the feedback in the first test, we changed our concept that two people working together to complete one picture instead of one person drawing each. We also increased the variety of constraints. In the second test, we saw participants enjoyed it much more than before. Finally, we made wood dices with 8 faces, 40 cards with keywords, and instruction paper. We selected keywords that are conceptual and can be interpreted differently by different people such as "sustainable".

### Collanque: a collaborative petanque

##### Morgane Rousseau, Helen Staak, Florens Schwendowius

#### Game concept

The concept of the game is that a group of people have to throw a ball collaboratively.
They have to communicate well to coordinate their movement, so that the ball flies in the right direction.

#### Rules of the game

The game is played between two to four teams of two to four players. Each team uses three balls.

To start, place the tiny pink ball (called *cochonnet*) on the ground and distribute the different shapes around it with a equal distance of one large step.

Build teams and choose a color. Then grab the fabric and balls of your team color you chose and place yourself five large steps away of the cochonnet.

In team of four, every members gets a leash to grab, or if there are only two players in the team, every team member gets two leashes to grab. Then place a ball on top of the fabric.
In team of three, you fold the opposite corners of the fabric to make a triangle.

You’re aim is to get as close as possible to the “cochonnet”. You repeat this step with the second and third ball. 

When all balls are thrown, measure which ball is the closest to the “cochonnet”.
The team that has thrown this ball gets three points. And whose ball is the furthest away gets one minus point.

After counting the points, collect the balls and start the new round.
The team that gets to 9 points first is the winning team.

**SHAPES**
When a thrown ball lands on a shape the team has to do an extra difficulty in the next throw:
- Stand on one leg during the next throw.
- Close your eyes during the next throw.
- You’re not allowed to speak during the next throw.
- Throw from five steps further away during the next throw.

#### Restrictions of the game

Minimum two people in a team, maximum four. Minimum two teams, maximum four. For the best experience, it is recommended to be played outdoors, on grass, gravel or flat terrain, where the balls do not roll away or bounce too much.


#### What was the process during the game design

After going through a lot of ideas we landed on a concept, which we gave a working name "collaborative petanque". The initial inspiration came from two already existing games: petanque and parachute. As petanque is a very popular game around France, wich we also saw played a lot around the school grounds, we wanted to take this already familiar concept and find ways to make it more collaborative.

<figcaption>Iteration with a first prototype</figcaption>

#### Iteration

Our first idea was to use the regular petanque boules and some kind of fabric that would be used to throw the boules. We tested the first idea of the game outside on the school grounds by using a stone and a jacket. When we saw that it could work we started searching for materials to create our first prototype. We were able to use the leftover fabric from the Design Biennale and created our first version of the game. When the fabric was done, we tested it with different paper balls and then bought different sized balls from the store to see how they work with the game. We also moved away from the original formation of the petanque game, where people play the game one after each other in a line. We thought it might be much more emotional, when the teams are placed in a circle facing each other. After that we tested the game with two teams and different kinds of balls outside on grass. Everything seemed to work well, but we felt that the game was still missing something. We got a recommendation from our mentors that we could add some additional features to make the game more challenging. We decided to create shapes out of cardboard that could be put on the ground while playing and would challenge the players more. We also decided to add leashes to the fabric so it would be more comfortable to hold them. The final version of the shapes for the game were lasercut from plywood and we also decided to engrave the challenges on them, so they would always be visually there and easy to keep in mind while playing.

#### Testing

The testing was a crucial part in our design process.
Right from the start we tested our ideas and developed them further with the experiences we made. While testing the game the participants had very interesting ideas for variations of the game that differed from the original idea. Therefore the game could additionally be used in other ways as well.

- using the fabrics to throw and catch a ball in two teams of two to four people
- using the circle shape in the middle to throw the ball through it and catch it with the fabric
- using the circle in the middle on the ground and make the ball bounce in the middle of the circle

#### End Result

The end result is the game called "collanque". The name is a combination of "petanque" the word for a french boules sport, in which players play their boules/balls towards a target ball. The game consists of one small ball to place in the middle, three different sized and weighted balls for each team to throw, fabrics for teams of two to four people to throw the ball with and four different shapes to put on the ground for extra challenges.

<figcaption>Screenshot a one of the game level</figcaption>

#### Game concept

You play as a designer who always tries to find new tech to improve thier work. For that, you bought a brand new 5D printer... from a shady website... You tried to print your file, BUT it broke your reality in half. You and your friend have to work together to merge the reality into one again.


#### Rules of the game

Your room used to be purple but because the reality split into two dimensions, so did your room, some of the objects in it and the color of it. One player plays in the split reality of the red room while the other player is in the blue room. The objects in your room that are the colour of the opposite room, are keys to fix your reality. 

When placed into the 5D printer they reveal riddles that give you a code to teleport the objects to the right reality. For some of the riddles you will have to collaborate with your friend because crucial hints to your riddle are hidden in their room.

The goal is to solve all the riddles so your realities can merge again and you can return to your purple room.


#### Restrictions of the game

You are not able to talk to your friend through the game. It is meant to be played while you are in different locations so you have to find other ways to communicating like call or text to emulate the different realities. 

The game can be played offline since technically they are two mystery games that are intended to be played alongside eachother since they contain hints to the other players game.

#### What was the process during the game design?

Initially we were thinking about a detective game or a mystery game. The idea itself was there in the beginning but the plot needed some tweaking since it would be the central point of the game.

At first we discussed about the story of a physics professor that had a science experiment gone wrong. Because of this failed experiment his reality would split in two.

#### Testing

We developed the riddles and then went around asking people to solve them. Some of them took longer to solve and others were pretty straightforward. It depended a lot on the person and their experience. 

Knowing some pop culture references made the process easier too. We thought about the target group of our game which could be people that grew up with these pop culture moments and share them with people of other generations. To make it acessible to everyone we decided to add some hints.


### The Cube

##### Maëlys Bard, Alféa Morelli, Mark Uustalu

#### Game concept

The Cube is a cooperative game for two people. It's an interactive story telling game, but it's also kind of like an escape game. The story goes like this. There is one friend who is stuck in a bar and they need to escape, but they had too many beers and they don't know where they are. They call another friend who will try to come help and hopefully save them. If you successfully save them then you will live happily ever after. As previously stated one of the players is in the bar and they see the bar through images that they can switch between. They will have to look around the bar to find out information which they must tell the their friend. The other person plays the game on the computer and has choices presented to them and they must communicate to answer all the riddles correctly.

#### Rules of the game

You have to communicate with your partner in order to win.
Spamming through answers is not allowed. You need to actually try to complete the riddles.

#### What was the process during the game design

Firstly we decided on making a video game. Then we got the idea of making it a storytelling game with choices and cooperation. Then we drew up sketches and the games path. Decided on who will do what and gave assignments. Process was smooth and everything went great. Nobody just sat around. We all worked on the story, but special thanks to Maëlys for thinking of most of the good stuff. Maëlys and Alféa made the 3D models and scenes in Blender. Mark created/coded the playable part of game in Twine.

#### Iteration

Core loop of the game is to solve the riddles/answer the questions, communicate with teammate to make correct choices, win/die.

#### Testing

Fully gameplay tested on a handful of different people and talked the idea through with teachers and other folks. Everyone liked it.

#### End Result

End result came out like we imagined. We wanted to make a game that isn't just a basic prototype, but something truly playable.

#### Inspiration

Our inspiration was the *trax* game. We liked the simplicity, the shapes and the intuitive way the game was designed. However, we wanted to design a game for more than two players, so we needed to bring the game to a higher complexity.

#### Ideas

So next up we played with geometrical shapes and building different symbols. Building a puzzle that can be assembled to different symbols depending on the focus colour. We prototyped this game in paper and really liked the result however we quickly realised that it was a non cooperative, single player game.
Therefore we kept the results of the different coloured lines on each squares, but we went back to the idea for tracks and having a starting and an ending point.

#### Conception

To make the game more collaborative we decided that each player should choose one colour and using the same ideas of the lines on the sqaure cards the goal is for the players to connect the starting and the ending point of their colour.
On this point the game *Connect* by  Ken Garland was introduced to us. The geometric and simple appearance really spoke to us. Furthermore we found the synonym of *train* or *metro* tracks.

#### Paper prototype

We decided to make little squares with the different geometrical shapes we need for the game for our first **paper prototype**. In this step we found out that there are many different variations possible which means that we need to figure out what versions and how many cards we need in general for a playable and fun game.

{% image "untitled_presentation-4.jpg", "We test a paper prototype", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw" %}

After producing the squares for the paper prototype we sat down to play a round and figure out some more details of the game. We quickly found out that we needed to restrict the amount of colours on each tile and that there can only be one line going out of each of the sides. Otherwise it would be to difficult to find corresponding pieces for the players to connect.
This left us with eleven different pieces and their colour variations.

#### Materials

In the next steps we were testing different materials for our pieces. We really liked the idea of clear plexiglass pieces with the colourful lines on it. So we set up a testing document in Illustrator and engraved the lines with the lasercutter into the plexiglass. Afterwards we coloured the lines by hand with posca markers.
The asthetics worked out,however we realised that it was not really practical in the usage: The onesided pieces can be turned around by accident and make the whole point of the pieces restricting the lines pointless. Our second version with two pieces in one (back and front) was confusing as well, as it might look like all of the lines would needed to be connected, which is not true. Furthermore, the paint scrates of quite fast, which is not practical in usage.

Our second test was with pressed wood. We drew the lines on it with the AxiDraw and then cut it in the lasercutter. This worked much better for the game, so we decided to use it for our final prototype.

#### Final game

Our game is called metro, the goal is to finish the metro line and conclude your travels. It´s designed for up to  four players, each having to complete their coloured lines. Our final Prototype consistes of 72 unique pieces and the game instructions.

#### Rules

Game for two to four players.

Before the game:
- every player decides one one colour (orange, red, blue or green), the pieces with end and start points are part of the stack and have to be found by taking a new piece every turn
- every player gets three pieces, the rest will be stacked on the side
- the player whose birthday is next starts the game 

During the game:
- the player starts by taking a piece from the stack 
	**or** from the metro plan already constructed (not possible for the very first move)
- one of the four pieces now **has to be added to the metro plan**
- the pieces can only be added if the lines fit to all of the surrounding pieces
- the pieces have to be laid out so that each "empty" space has no more than two different colours ending it

#### Congratulations!

The player who has both their staring and ending point of the metro line connected first, wins.


## Conclusion and openings

During the first workshop in Tallinn, we had the feeling of passing an important step, this was also the case here.

The notions of collaboration, cooperation and participation appeared more complex than we had anticipated: it was the major topic of the week and students were invited to participate to the reflection on those notions.

The theme of games fulfilled its purpose to serve as a common cultural basis, with students tracking the tiny national differences of some of them and sharing games they like. It also allowed students to design games with the technical knowledge and tools at their disposal respectively within their team and within Esadse. Everyone was then in a kind of "comfort area" since no methods or tools were imposed.

The process of the game design also allowed us to step aside and move away, for a moment, from the digital and functional perspectives that we are used to.

Finally, we had the feeling that student had a great time and got the chance to know better each others, mostly by working together in international teams. Their differences in methods were less visible than in the previous workshop and were mostly percieved as an added value.
