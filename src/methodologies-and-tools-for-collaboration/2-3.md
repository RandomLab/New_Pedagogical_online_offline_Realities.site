## Being critical about the digital tools we use: a cross-disciplinary issue

From the beginning of the project, we knew that it was necessary to have
a theoretical perspective from researchers and practitioners involved in
the subjects that will occupy us for two years. The lecturers we invited
in Esadse to give conferences in the framework of DTCC, were chosen to
give students aside perspectives on the subject of tools for
collaboration, in and out of the creative field. As inter-disciplinary
projects are more and more common whether in schools or in the
professional world, we thought it would be interesting to question the
digital tools others are using for collaboration. We also chose all
these lecturers for their critical approach on tools and the numerous
issues raised by digital technologies, in line with our pedagogy.

We first invited Vincent Hugoo, to enlighten us on the survey, from a
sociological perspective, to understand how we could borrow some
methodological tools to enrich our preliminary explorations.

The work of Tallulah Frappier imposed itself by questioning the
governance and the political dimension of exchange as a democratic act
on web platforms.

In the continuity, we invited Angie Gaudion, who represents Framasoft,
an association famous for its involvement in the production and
distribution of free software.

We set aside the practice in interaction design, to focus on different
perspectives, and to finish this theoretical cycle, we chose to invite
Sarah Garcin, an important creator of the French scene in the field of
graphic design and digital practices.

## Vincent Hugoo: The Sociological Survey
#### 14 December 2021, Esadse

> Vincent Hugoo is a doctoral student at the European Center for Sociology
and Political Science (CESSP, EHESS/Paris 1). His research focuses on
the relational processes that surround daily life --- sociability,
interactions, socialization ---, considered from the angle of class and
gender, and on the development and role of the French school system in
foreign countries.

This lecture focused on the method of inquiry in the humanities and
social sciences, as a scientific approach to the social world. It
explained the principle of inquiry and gave an overview of the different
techniques -- observations, interviews, questionnaires, work on
secondary data -- as they fulfill distinct objectives.

Debate plays a major role in many theories of democracy: it is the basis
of all legitimate decisions. As an oratory practice and an exchange of
ideas between several people, one might think that debate depends only
on the individuals who lead it. However, from the agora to the internet
forum, the debate is regularly accompanied by materialities and
procedures that concretize the explicit and implicit rules that
structure it. It becomes a propitious subject for the designer\'s
reflection who is able to ask himself how these objects linked to the
debate reveal and condition it.

Faced with the monopolies of the digital giants (GAFAM, NATU, BATX,
etc.) that generate huge profits on the processing and sale of our
personal data, it is becoming urgent to gradually regain control of our
digital life. With the Framasoft association, understand why free
software and services are essential in a process of digital emancipation
and discover ethical, decentralized, solidarity-based alternatives that
are more respectful of your privacy.

Over the past twenty years, advancements in technology have made remote
work easily accessible. Writing texts, discussing ideas, and
collaborating on projects with multiple individuals remotely has become
a common practice. It is now routine to work with colleagues, clients,
service providers, friends, and collaborators, even without ever meeting
them in person. While this conference acknowledges the well-known
phenomenon of remote collaboration, its focus is on introducing
experimental tools that enable collaboration in the same physical space
and in real-time.
