## Being critical about the digital tools we use : a cross-disciplinary issue

From the beginning of the project, we knew that it was necessary to have a theoretical perspective on the subject, from researchers involved in the subjects that will occupied us for two years.

We first invited Vincent Hugoo, to enlighten us on the survey, from a sociological perspective, to understand how we could borrow some methodological tools to enrich our preliminary explorations.

The work of Tallulah Frappier imposed itself by questioning the governance and the political dimension of exchange as a democratic act on web platforms.

In the continuity, we invited Angie Gaudrion, who represents Framasoft, an association famous for its involvement in the production and distribution of free software.

We set aside the practise in interaction design, to focus on different perspectives, and to finish this throrical cycle, we choose to invite Sarah Garcin, an important creator on the French scene in the field of graphic design and digital practices.

This lecture focused on the method of inquiry in the humanities and social sciences, as a scientific approach to the social world. It explained the principle of inquiry, and gave an overview of the different techniques - observations, interviews, questionnaires, work on secondary data - as they fulfill distinct objectives.

Debate plays a major role in many theories of democracy: it is the basis of all legitimate decisions. As an oratory practice and an exchange of ideas between several people, one might think that debate depends only on the individuals who lead it. However, from the agora to the internet forum, the debate is regularly accompanied by materialities and procedures that concretize the explicit and implicit rules that structure it. It becomes a propitious subject for the designer's reflection who is able to ask himself how these objects linked to the debate reveal and condition it.

Faced with the monopolies of the digital giants (GAFAM, NATU, BATX, etc.) that generate huge profits on the processing and sale of our personal data, it is becoming urgent to gradually regain control of our digital life. With the Framasoft association, understand why free software and services are essential in a process of digital emancipation and discover ethical, decentralized, solidarity-based alternatives that are more respectful of your privacy.

Since the last twenty years, the evolution of technology has made it easy to work remotely. It is now common to write a text, to discuss, to build a project with several people remotely. It has become commonplace to work with colleagues, clients, service providers, friends, collaborators. Somme never met in real life. This conference will not abord this (too) well known visio-life, but will propose experimental tools to collaborate in the same place and at the same time.
