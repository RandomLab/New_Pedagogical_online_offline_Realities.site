# Methodologies and tools for collaboration

Our tools build practice and our practice build tools. This formula has been going through artists and designers community who are interested in digital practices for some time now. At Esadse, we have made it the roots of our pedagogy. We have approach very early from the first exchanges subjects as tools, use, governance. We know that communication, sharing and design tools condition our creative gestures, and we have integrated them, but each team, school and country develops its own culture of relationship with technology and even more specifically with digital technology.

We still struggle to distance ourselves from these kind of topic : we are all practitioners, students, teachers.

This project, which lasted two years and was rich in exchanges and experiences, had an indisputable effect on us, especially students: a questioning, a critical positioning and strong interrogations on our methods and the uses of the digital tools of creation by collaboration by comparing their modalities, origins and realities in a school and also professional context are essential to build futur, in the face of climate and political challenges for the next years.
