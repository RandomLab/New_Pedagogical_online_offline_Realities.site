## Post-workshop : designing post-pandemic tools for collaboration, student's projects.

After a few months, following the first workshop at the EKA, in Tallinn, Estonia, in October, our students continued their research by reconstituting new teams. 
Each school, according to its organization and its pedagogical calendar, has integrated the subjects evoked during the first workshops into its curriculum and pedagogy.

We organized a Final presentation of the students' projects the 18th february 2022.

### A plugin for making small comments on a document with voice

<figcaption>Plugin for Google Doc</figcaption>

#### Why is this tool for?
My final concept is a plugin for making small comments on a document with voice.

#### Who is this tool for?
This tool is for teams working online.

#### How does it work?
When you give a comment on Google docs, you can record a short voice comment within 30 secs. On the other hand, when you check a comment, you can listen to the voice comment with automatic transcription.

#### What type of collaboration is it made for?
Asynchronous collaboration, feedbacks.

#### How did I came up with this idea?
To begin with, I have identified some research questions for the project: what kind of digital tools do people use for collaboration? Why? How do they collaborate online by using the tools? What kind of problems do they have? etc. Based on those questions, I conducted desk research and interviews with people with experience in both office and remote working.

My main findings through the research are that losing small and quick interaction/feedback they had at an office could slow down their work online and that in remote working, text-based communication is increasingly replacing oral communication and non-verbal communication.

Text-based communication helps communication be more accurate and well-structured, and it is also suitable for recording. However, at the same time, texted-based communication is time-consuming and difficult to communicate feelings and emotions compared to oral communication. Based on those findings, I decided to focus on the problem of lack of rough and small feedback in working online.


### A plugin for check-in and check-outs

##### Alicia HARDEGEN (EKA)

<figcaption>Plugin for check-in and out</figcaption>


#### Why is this tool for?
This is a video meeting tool plugin for check-in and check-out questions. Already many design teams use them. It functions as a seatbelt to check if someone needs help or can support others. 

The check-in would be about warming up, checking on each other, sharing something personal in order to create a digital environment where you can connect with each other; whereas the check-out would be more about reflecting, appreciation and feedback.

#### Who is this tool for?
This plugin is made for remote workers teams and online classes.

#### How does it work?
One person for example the moderator writes a check-in question, that for example fits the current session. An own question usually shows more honest interest, but there is also the possibility to generate a question if inspiration is desired.

Next, the question is answered in turn. Visually it is made visible who is currently talking and who has not yet answered the question. If a person does not want to answer the check-in question, he can press a button and change his status without answering the question.

After everyone has answered the question, the meeting can start.

When you leave the meeting, you are automatically transported to the check-out room, where a previously entered or generated question about appreciation, feedback or self-reflection appears. The answers that are typed in here are made available either anonymously or with names depending on the group's default settings. Since some people might need to leave earlier the concept is, that everyone types the check-out individual and this is something which is stored.

#### How did I came up with this idea?
After the workshop week we reseted all we discussed about. Within the EKA team we spoke about what different type of collaborative apps there are and what our experience were so far. In order to find patterns and problems within the different categories we decided to divide the categories. Together with Quinn I researched on the topic communication.

In order to create a HMW we looked what complains and praises were written about the five tools, which we already had looked at. We collected quotes from Quora and reddit on entries like "What are the benefits of Slack?" Or "What are the pros and cons in Zoom." All these quotes were marked with keywords. In the same table I also added quotes from small guerrilla interviews. Overall we had many different problems and patterns, but what stuck with me the most were comments about how zoom failed to create a social environment and how it created loneliness and distance.

My fist approach to generate ideas was the crazy 8 method. Here I sketched different solutions for my HMW like a way to enhance giving feedback, how to add functions to support showing emotions or how to give space to talk about private stuff. Since in the end all these aspects were about sharing information with each other to connect I thought back about how to get to know people in real life and especially all the times were I was in a situation were I had to get to know people in a group. I remembered many group situations where games were played.

So I started to read articles what kind of games were suggested for remote teams to let the team spirit grow. The problem I saw with many of those online games, like a photo competition, was that often they take a lot of effort to prepare or can be only played one time, but than I stumbled on an article about Team Check-Ins and Check-Outs.

### A Slack plug-in that showcases the user's soft and hard skills

##### Sigmund ABOU CHROUCH (EKA)

> How might we establish a meaningful connection across a group that can help all its members equally in their personal growth with digital tools?

<figcaption>Plugin for slack</figcaption>

#### Why is this tool for?
The final concept is a Slack plug-in that showcases the user's soft skills, hard skills and tools that they know, which would help their team to collaborate more efficiently. Such a plug-in would also break the barrier of shyness and invite people to seek assistance in a more confident way, where it ignites a sense of mentorship and learning.

#### Who is this tool for?
Slack-user medium to large teams.

#### How does it work?
The user would input their top skills which would appear on a hexagon graph. Such a graph would help team members understand who they need to talk to for assistance or collaboration. It would also display to people that are outside the organization.

Each collaboration would end in feedback that the other user can give by "endorsing them" either on the skills that the user already have or by a new skill.

The top six skills (in the soft and hard skills) that have been most endorsed will always appear on the graph unless a new skill has got more endorsement. Then the new one would appear on the graph, and so on.

#### How did I came up with this idea?
As a team, we've spent the first two weeks understanding the world of collaborative applications by trying to define who are the main players and their USP (Unique Selling points), their competitors, to check if there are any blogs, videos etc about these main applications. In addition, we took the time to talk to people that actually use those applications that have been identified, understand from them how they engage with, what are their pain points, what do they like and dislike, what problems they have faced and how they solved it. We wanted to acquire all the needed information that could help us understand the matter better. We were also encouraged to engage in the applications, use them and reflect on their use.

When checking the data collected by the team, two patterns were highlighted for me, which were that one group of people didn't know how to use the applications properly or weren't able to take advantage of the features for the lack of training and another group that was able to work on them confidently and easily. Therefore, what if the second group was able to guide the first group, leading me to the following: how might we establish a meaningful connection across a group that can help all its members equally in their personal growth with digital tools?

Once the problem has been identified with data and insights that we've collected and opportunities that we've uncovered, coming up with ideas to solve it can be unlimited. It is very important to put a certain guideline or a pathway that could guide the process of ideating, such would be called design principals which I've identified as follows:
- Engaging: An important component that enables a crucial element that is communication.
- Individual: In a collaborative effort, the collective's spirit and growth are determined by each individual's spirit and growth, therefore, the solution should facilitate individual growth.
- Uplifting: Constructive criticism, acknowledging milestones, lending hand etc contribute to the growth of the individual but also in the growth of the collective. And all that was mentioned in the beginning have a goal in recognizing the progress of the person, resulting in uplifting them rather than the opposite.

With these principles in mind, I proceeded with ideating by using the crazy 8 method which is the "core component of the design sprint stage within design thinking." I was able to come up with 5 ideas, which were:
- A platform with free resources that everyone can contribute to and collaborate in creating. Individuals can create guides and resources and share them with everyone through the platform and such resources can be upgraded by everyone.
- Virtual Rooms for different purposes such as rooms for discussions, designing, ideating etc, where each virtual room holds the suitable tools for the corresponding theme.
- Gamifying the experience, where each person is celebrated in what they do best and how they collaborate, also highlighting the qualities of the individual in a group.
- Virtual Campfire where everyone is given their own time to share their thoughts
- An interactive box that is connected to va- arious other boxes. When one box has been lit with a certain color, all other boxes are lit with the same color, paving a way to connect with others remotely.

Out of the 5 ideas, I moved forward with "Gamifying the experience". The core idea of it is that it aids in one's personal development, showcases their skill sets (hard skills, soft skills) and establishes connections through highlighting the strengths of the individuals.

Through my research on gamification, the main elements of it stood out that, collectively, would define the gamification experience (Teodorescu, 2018). Other sources in my research of the elements that would establish the solution decided on were: Linkedin skill assessments and skill endorsements, where people can endorse you to enhance visibility and credibility.

Another resource was shared with me by Alicia which is a Slack plug-in called Hi-Ki, where one can tag anyone in their team with their skills, interest or field of expertise which can be added to their profile on Slack. The point of this plug-in is to get to know each other and get closer, get the recognition for the work, find out who has the know-how to tackle a specific task/solve a problem and have insight into the strengths and talents of the entire team.

This led to the first raw idea: a plug-in for slack that is optional to install for the team, where the goal is to develop their skills in the use of digital tools by collaborating, helping and learning (hard skills and soft skills). Giving the user the chance to engage with their teammates, where they can also help and guide others in developing new skills by assisting them if they ask for assistance.

### Yarte

##### Artemiy GUSLISTOV & Yareni DURIEZ URIAS (EKA)

> What happens when the references that most of the digital tools are based on, do not match any of your experiences or references?

![yarte!_10.jpg](img/yarte!_10.jpg)
<figcaption>Yarte!</figcaption>

#### Why is this tool for?
Based on the research, analysis and understanding of the popular, most useful & almost standard tools that have become part of our daily life, we designed the concept of **a plug-in for spontaneous collaborative drawn-art** we called Yarte.

The concept supports the idea of the help, motivations and inspiration that having or gibing a context represents. Additionally, it is thought to be an easy first-hand experience in the creative environment for people that desire to join, or that would like to have access to this world and it's possibilities with specific purposes such as for visual communication of work, ideas, plans, etc.

#### How does it work?
We decided for it to be a plug-in that could be used as a complement for the work that being done in other digital tools, with the purpose of replicating the facility and experience of having a notebook for sketching ideas. The difference within the notebook experience and the plug-in "yarte" would be the support and instant follow up that the tool will provide to the user, based on the "context" given by the user themselves.

#### What type of collaboration is it made for?
With this approach to the digital tools, we found the potential for this facility of creation to become a collaborative environment in the open platform for people to test-advertise their art work as NFT's in order to have access to the statistic that would be proof & reference of the usage and audience that their work reaches.

The value of these scheme is in the value of data and previous experience in the current professional work career building; especially in the art and creative fields.

#### How did we came up with this idea?
After the workshop week, all the students from EKA formed a team in order to gather a more integral research on the topic of the digital tools that are part of our everyday life. This helped us to identify what are the interfaces, interaction & practices that had an area of opportunity to be improved. During our research upon the existing digital tools, and more specifically about the most popular ones, we found interesting & defining quotes and statements on the comments, reviews and websites on those. This findings led us to establish our own conclusions between the popular opinion and our own experience and expectation when using digital tools for creativity and & or for collaboration.

![yarte!_3.jpg](img/yarte!_3.jpg)
<figcaption>Yarte!</figcaption>

On the next stage of our research, we made clear what is the difference between the existing tools and why is not everybody using the same ones: What do they offer that is different but keep them within the same category at the same time? To whom is each one dedicated to? What helps one decide or feel identified better with one or another?

Among a variety of answers, more questions and conclusion, we mapped the specific difference that distinguishes the tools that provide easy access to the world of possibilities (1) from the one's that replicate the tools to put into practice the talent or skill that one might have exercised before out of a screen (2) :
- **(1) corresponds to the "Accessibility" category** of digital tools, which represents the programs and apps and websites that allow one to explore an alien world, far from our real abilities and/or possibilities, but very close to our imagination and desires. It suggests and facilitate tools that might only be available in the digital world, but also regular or analog tools with exponential "power" or "capacity",
- **(2) is the "Possibilities" category**, which addresses the tools, programs, apps and websites that provide specific tools that replicate the usage of the analog one is a high fidelity mode. Thus, it also helps for replicated the user's capabilities and possibilities to represent the desired outcome with the facility of using the screen, in addition to having access to a whole world of tools.

![yarte!_5.jpg](img/yarte!_5.jpg)
<figcaption>Yarte!</figcaption>

As seen in the map above, we identified that the common point between the two categories is the experience required for both of them; however, at the same time the two categories are driven by different motivations and strengths: Instinct & Abilities.

We concluded then that the experience is put into practice equally in both cases, although in different forms (instinct & ability), and that Intuition is the engine that would push and motivate the user to continue using or experimenting with the tools in order to acquire expertise or to improve the knowledge on determined digital environments, or tool of tools.

To identify these two fields of approach to creativity in the digital worlds, made us realize that the digital world, although providing possibilities, also limiting the unexperienced users. The instinct that we have mentioned before can only exist and be effective when one has had the opportunity to build some experience among certain environment.

But, what about the people that would like to implement unexplored abilities that they think could have, or wish the would? To join the digital world is no longer only and option or an alternative. For sure there are certain things that can and should be preserved in the analog and physical experience, but the digital tools should back up and help the experience of te representation of our ideas and the messages that need and, more importantly, can be distributed around the world so easily nowadays.

This is why we decided to focus on the side question of "what happens when the references that most of the digital tools are based on, do not match any of your experiences or references?". Not being identified within a world does not mean that our instinct will be turned off when its references and archives do not match the gives world. It will act with whatever it has been fed off and execute base on those possibilities.

We found other examples of the role that references and instinct play in the execution of a creative plan or idea, such as children paint books, fashion games magazines, architecture exercises and games, and some products that already provide the starting point of an idea and facilitate the user to come up with ideas for complementing the original element; in other words, examples that help the user with the panic of starting from a blank page! Indeed, we noticed that when a context as a starting point is given, engagement becomes more natural and works as an engine or motor for the references in our minds to start building creating from that.

One popular example that we could use as a reference is the game Minecraft, in which the most characteristic property is the explorative and freedom balance between building for an specific purpose that oneself sets as a goal for every time one plays. The context is given by the world of the game, and the player or the user decides what do they need or want to add to it. In addition to that, the tool for creating compatible and ideal pieces for each environment is part of the game, and provides the accessibility to making and the flexibility to personalize and edit whenever is wanted. After breaking this successful example down, it became easier to identify other worlds where the same or a similar philosophy was being used, with a good variety of usages. One example is the "text" tool that is already part of different and independent apps, supports the user with the placeholder text "Lorem Ipsum" that examplifies the visual form of a text box without relying on meaningful content. The second example that we kept on mind in our process is the Google Images tool / option, which only asks for a word or a sentence (context) in order to provide images that would match this starting point. This also usually start an "endless" door of possibilities since, everytime you open the pre-visualization of one of the options images given, google images suggests / shows more images similar or related specifically to the one selected.

### curious.me

##### Vanessa SIGG & Yannick HOFFMEISTER (HfG)

> How to get the user out of his “bubble” and arouse his curiosity?


#### Why is this tool for?
curious.me is a mobile app designed to arouse and encourage curiosity. This is often lost due to everyday stress, lack of time and other factors. Corona also has an influence on this, because many people miss the exchange with others due to working in the home office, and thus new impressions and inspiration.

curious.me offers the user a wealth of articles on interesting topics and the opportunity to delve deeper into the topics. Value is placed on getting the user out of his “bubble” and offering him topics that he has hardly or not at all dealt with before. This ensures new stimuli and areas of interest, and thus the chance to arouse curiosity.

#### Who is this tool for?
curious.me is primarily intended to help creative people and people working in creative areas to get new impressions and inspiration for future projects. However, since curiosity can be aroused in everyone and the range of topics is very wide, the app is also suitable for the general public.

#### How does it work?
Curiosity is encouraged by curious.me through setting tasks that can be solved. If you find the topic or the solution to the task you are interested in, you can satisfy your curiosity and get into the topic associated with the task. Statistics also give an insight into topics that the user has dealt with the most and thus insight into their own interests.

curious.me features:
- **Articles:** curious.me offers a variety of articles to browse through at will. A brief introduction to the topic, tags, a headline and attractive images convey the first impression of the article on offer. If interested, the article can be read in its entirety and further articles related to the overarching topic can be read via endless scrolling.

![article.png](img/curious_article.png)
<figcaption>curious.me</figcaption>

- **Tasks:** When you open curious.me for the first time of the day, you are greeted with a question or task. Estimation questions and other similar tasks are intended to arouse curiosity about the topic in question. After answering the question, the corresponding article is offered for reading. But you can also skip the article and end up in the normal article view.

![tasks.png](img/curious_tasks.png)
<figcaption>curious.me</figcaption>

- **Library:** If an article is interesting and you would like to be able to look at it again later, or if you don't have time at the moment but are curious about an article, the article can be saved in your personal library. Articles can also be organized by assigning folders to them.

![tasks.png](img/curious_library.png)
<figcaption>curious.me</figcaption>

- **Dashboard:** The dashboard provides information about which topics have aroused the most interest and how diligently you have used the app. The tasks can also be found and called up here. There are also evaluations for these. Another option found here is the ability to submit articles that you think are good and useful.

### Mosaic

##### Lucie WITTMER & Thang NGUYEN (HfG)

> Why not be creative together?


#### Why is this tool for?
MOSAIC is a collaboration tool for artists to work together on creative projects. This is to simplify working remotely in agencies and with other artists around the world and combine multiple workspaces into one.

Isolation Kills Creativity: a lot of artists, especially illustrators, work very isolated and the pandemic has made this issue even more severe. In times like these we are lacking outside influences and inspiration from others.

MOSAIC brings community back into remote work and allows for agencies and independent illustrators to create their own illustrations together. In it’s focus stand communication and collaboration, which make the users feel close to their colleagues, even if they are worlds apart. Working with artists around the world gives the opportunity to explore new art styles and combine them in one artwork. The goal for this tool was also to make interdisciplinary work possible, by including animators or authors into the project.

#### Who is this tool for?
MOSAIC is made for isolated artists and designer (especially for illustrators).

#### How does it work?
In the drawing tool Itself the users will find all the tools they need for creating illustrations:

![mosaic_1_menu.png](img/mosaic_1_menu.png)
<figcaption>Mosaic</figcaption>

As well as other special features that allow for easier communication, such as a voice chat or the option to ask your colleagues for advice on an artwork. These collaborative features seperate MOSAIC from your ordinary drawing tool like Procreate, Illustrator or Photoshop.

### reflect.it

##### Bianca TILLMANN & Luis PFLÜGER (HfG)

> We don’t learn from experience, we learn from reflecting our experiences.

#### Who is this tool for?
reflect.it is a cross platform tool for reflection at work. You can reflect your work on your own, or in a team. You can also use reflect.it to check in and out of work.

#### How does it work?
To document your thoughts, you can write down notes for every question. Choosing between multiple categories gives you exactly the questions you want.

To make check ins and outs and retrospectives in a team easier, you can use the reflect.it zoom plugin. By discussing the questions together, team communication can be improved.

Every time you reflect on your own, reflect.it will ask you about your current mood. The data gained from these assessments is then used to show you statistics about your mood history, your average day and your average week. These statistics are useful to analyse how your work makes you feel and to find the specific reasons for especially good or bad moods.

#### What type of collaboration is it made for?
We aimed to create a tool that every person working in front of a screen can use to reflect their work and create a healthier work environment and better work habits.

#### How did we came up with this idea?
Reflection is one of the most important skills to have, but it’s especially important in the workplace. It can help us understand and improve our own behaviour, way of working and skills. While most of us are aware of the importance of reflection, we rarely take the time to ponder our feelings, thoughts and actions and to analyse them.

### Illustration protocols with Free Softwares (Esadse)

##### Adrien DELIMARD, Heloïse DEBRAND, Manon PICAT, Mathias HU & Samantha ZANNONI

#### Short presentation of the project : how did we came up with that idea?
Free culture (social movement, subculture, philosophy) is largely derived from free software, but is much broader and includes other aspects (music, food, movies). 
It promotes certain beliefs such as the fact that knowledge and learning should be available to all, that no entity should dominate others. It induces a form of horizontality by distributing power among the members of the community.
There is an asymmetrical relationship between the engineer who designs, who owns the knowledge, and the user who uses, does not know, and is potentially used. 
We feel the need to reclaim the tools, to understand them and to regain sovereignty over them.

#### Why is this tool for?
Research and share software used in the school. Interview administration, faculty, technicians. Organize this.

#### How does it work?
How work the school system with the digital tools like adobe? Some investigation about that. We are "forced" to use some tools since the beginning of our studies. 
Each week, do a short presentation of things we found on the subjects we are interested in.
Try also some collaborative tools/process together

#### What type of collaboration is it made for?
We would like to invite other students or professionals in the field of Arts and Design, in which we evolve, who use standardized software, to take a step back, to ask themselves questions, to look beyond their interfaces, to be aware of what they are using to become full actors of their digital creation experiences. Autonomous and independent professionals, an ideal that, like any utopia, cannot be fully realized. 

#### How did we came up with this idea?
Question changing priorities. 
Companies do not have the right to make mistakes. 
However, from mistakes are sometimes born the most surprising achievements.

### Collective digital illustration protocols

#### Wave of specialists

Participants choose one digital drawing tool each. Participants choose and/or design one or more digital formats from which they will be able to experiment while drawing. Participants must agree on the number of colors or shades of gray that can be used and that of the background. Participants should agree on the number of colors or shades of gray that can be used and the background color. The participants divide up the roles in the following order:

- The "contour designer(s)": One or more people draw several imprecise shapes that the figure drawer(s) will figure.
- The "figure drawer(s)": One or more people transform the shapes into figures.
- Shade and contrast designer(s)": One or more people deal with colors and contrasts.
- The "detail designer(s)": One or more people add graphic details (patterns, textures, gradients, etc.).

The participants agree on the export and the final format of the composition. It is possible to double the roles by assigning the decor to one group and the characters to another.

#### Rumor of a sentence

- Each participant uses the digital medium of their choice to draw.
- Participants decide together the order in which they will draw.
- One of the participants opens a book to any page and reads the first sentence he/she finds.
- From this sentence, the first participant will draw a picture for 5 minutes.
- The first participant sends his drawing to the second participant who will reproduce it faithfully or modify it in 5 minutes on his format before sending it to the second and so on until the last participant.
- Participants design a composition by combining their drawing, the signatures of each participant and the original sentence using an online sharing tool or by designating a member of the group to share their screen and manipulate the elements.  

#### Talking drawing

Participants choose whether or not to time themselves. Participants form groups of four.
The roles to be distributed are: the draftsman, the colorist, the graphic designer and the writer.
Together, they choose a medium and a format and take turns. The order is determined by the team.  

- The designer draws the elements of the composition.
- The colorist takes care of the color and textures.
- The graphic designer prepares a text area.
- The writer chooses one or more typefaces and writes a text related to the image.

The groups present their work to the others and choose to put them together or a way to present them that distinguishes them. It would be interesting to reverse the order and see the effect. It is possible to combine the tasks and form groups of two.

#### Cycles

One participant performs a trace.
Another participant performs another one, close to the first one.
The operation is repeated until all participants feel that the traces form a satisfactory and well-structured composition.
Variation(s): Participants can choose to move or distort elements rather than draw.  The protocol can be performed without using speech.

#### Chewable Fictions

Participants determine a running order by drawing lots, alphabetical order, "plopping" or any other possible technique.  
The first participant represents a scene including a setting, a character and an action.
Following the direction of play, the next participant represents the next scene.
The protocol ends when a participant concludes the story.
The participants give a title to this story.

#### Mise en abyme

The participants determine an order of passage by drawing lots, alphabetical order, by making the "ploum" or any other possible technique.  
All participants choose a common area and zoom in to the maximum.
The first participant draws.
The second participant zooms out slightly and draws in turn including the first realization in his.
The action is repeated until the zoom out is exhausted.
Variation: Try with a time limit.

#### I write a drawing

Participants determine an order of passage by drawing lots, alphabetical order, by making the "ploum" or any other possible technique.  
Participants take turns writing a sentence on the page. The sentences do not necessarily have to be logical.
Each participant deconstructs the sentence of the previous participant in order to compose an illustration.  
The participants give one or more titles to the final compositions.
Alternatives: It is possible to allow the distortion of lines, the creation of new drawings after their destructuring or to limit the time.

One sentence less, one drawing more.

#### Why is this tool for?
While contemporary digital collaboration design often focuses on remote communication, Graphic Jam proposes to transform the computer back into a machine which physically brings people together. It transcribes the communication experience of local multiplayer video games into a graphic design context.

I envision a few use cases for this tool :
- **A jam tool for graphic designers**: As the entire process of creating a graphic is a very "hands-on" approach, interesting results can be created quite quickly.  It can be used as a kind of warm up tool for fueling new ideas in an informal and fun setting.
- **An installation displayed in an exhibition context:** The way of generating graphics and posters with the tool is a straight-forward process and is a nice for giving a public insight into a graphic design process and the effects of experimenting with shapes, colors, fonts, images, superpositions ...

#### Who is this tool for?
Graphic Jam is both made for graphic designers (experts) and for the public (non experts) to learn the basis of graphic design process through experimentation.

#### How does it work?
Developed with Processing, the graphic generator features a vector editor based on bezier curves, a bitmap editor and a font editor. This software must be simultaneously operated by two people using gamepads, as the graphic functions require cooperation and communication in order to unleash their full potential. The tactile approach leads to an instinctive workflow as well as happy accidents and therefore, interesting visuals results emerge swiftly straight from the first jam.

- **Shape editor:** 
The first "tool" or experiment that I developed is a shape editor based on bezier curves. The nature of the design of traditional computer input peripherals, such as keyboards, is to be used by one individual. Even if we manage to squeeze in front of the computer in order to use one keyboard simultaneously, we certainly can't do the same thing for only one mouse. As a result, it was an evident choice to me to apply a gamepad as a means to control my tool. Several can be plugged in at the same time on a computer, and they allow a variety of input values, which are useful for moving items on a screen. 
Consequently, I used two gamepads for the conception of this tool. Concerning the bezier editor, one joystick of each controller is mapped to control the anchor point of a bezier curve, whereas the second joystick controls the magnet point of the curve. Then, a timer of ten seconds sets off and is repeated in a loop: each time the timer reaches 0, the curve that is currently being edited stays in place, "printed" on our canvas, and a new curve controlled by the users appears.
The idea for introducing a timer system was inspired by the video game [Wario ware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarioWare:_Smooth_Moves), and aims at enhancing verbal communication between the users, which proves to be necessary in a fast-paced drawing context. It is also intended as an experiment investigating how this time and drawing constraint can potentially produce interesting shapes, similar to applications demonstrated here [Constraint Systems](https://constraint.systems/). The minimalist grid-based aesthetic was inspired by the image processing tool [Ronin](https://100r.co/site/ronin.html).

- **Bitmap editor**
Further pursuing these synchronous local experiments, I created a simple bitmap editor. It allows copying and pasting specific parts of a picture. Each user can control a cursor on the canvas, defining an area which can then be copied with the triggers, moved around, resized, and pasted.
After conceiving these two tools, it was necessary to assemble and place them into a fitting framework. Once merged, shapes drawn with bezier curves can be pasted on images with two blending modes. I realised throughout the project that I found the aspect of being able to generate quick visuals and posters to be even more interesting than creating independent graphic tools, which is why I decided to loose the timer after all. However, I added a button to "print" the curves more freely. Additionally, I added further parameters for altering the curves, such as the stroke cap shape, the width, color and saturation of the curve.

- **Font editor**
The final tool I added to my poster generator was a font editor. It has two modes: a writing mode, allowing to input text, and a deformation mode. The deformation mode works by cutting the text in small parts, and rearranging them on a grid. Users can then modify the size of the grid, the type and strength of the deformation, switch between different fonts, and duplicate a non deformed layer of the text. By quickly switching though and playing with the parameters, variations on the base font can be generated. Alternatively, a nonreadable texture may be generated which can be blended in the bitmap mode.

#### What type of collaboration is it made for?
Local mode real-time collaboration.

#### How did I came up with this idea?
The origin of this project is the observation that nowadays, most of the digital design propositions for collaboration focus on remote collaboration. This is true for productivity softwares, but also in the field of video-games. Most games propose many features in an online multiplayer context, but often no local mode. However, I have some very fond memories of playing video games with friends on a video game device. During these occasions, a special connection is built between players, as they act together on the gaming device and turning the computer into a social machine that brings people together. The project I have been working on aims at bringing theses special moments back into our contemporary relationship with computers, and in this case within the context of graphic design processes.

### Conclusion of this step

The post workshop ideas quickly evolved into more concrete projects, sometimes very specific, as devices, plugins, applications, or more experimental. Each integrat edthe pedagogical specificities of our pedagogical program.

This important step in the project allowed us to build the foundations of a sustained and solid collaboration, a common ground, to continu our work. 

We had underestimated the importance of a longer preparation in situ, with people and without communication apps but the pandemic was still there and we did as we were allowed to do under the circunstances. 

On the other hand, we anticipated the necessity to document everything, to produce a lot of text and images that would allow us later to come back on the multiple evolutions of our work together.
