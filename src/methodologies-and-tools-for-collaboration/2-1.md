The first workshop in Tallinn was also our first meeting IRL (in real life). Despite many very fruitful exchanges beforehand with Zoom and Big Blue Button, we had to synchronize our expectations in a very short time and didn't take the time to meet properly as the first meeting face to face had been canceled. Indeed, the context of the Covid 19 pandemic had a strong impact on the organization of this first week of collaborative work. 

Nonetheless, in October 2021, we finally got the chance to meet each other (students and teachers) in EKA, Tallinn. The week was intense and challenging from a pedagogical perspective as Esadse's students were kind of refractory to the google sprint model and design thinking methods proposed by EKA and comonly used by our partners. However, as the workshop was focused on students' experiences of remote learning, collaborative work and facing isolation during the pandemic, they had a lot to share.


### Subject and goals of the workshop

As the first workshop was following the pandemic and because the DTCC project was born out of its ashes, the subject of it was obviously based on our experiences of teachnig, learning and making together remotly. This week was dedicated to the inventory of tools we use for remote collaboration and to the sharing of the "good" or "bad" experiences we had with them. This served as a basis to a common reflection on what tools could have been better or complementary to those we have, in order to ease remote collaborations or to allow new ways of making together at a distance. 

During the whole project, workshops have been one of the ways to involve students in each steps of it. This one is part of the first phase of the DTCC project, dedicated to exploratory research (that was documented by EKA in this publication: **URL**, here, we inted to document this workshop from a pedagogical perspective). So the main aim of this workshop, was to get students' analyzing the digital tools they used for collaboration during the pandemic and reflecting on what tools have been missing to them. In this case, they were both the subjets of the study and the researchers.

### Introduction: projects and methods

As an introduction, some of the students as well as some of the teachers did talks to present their previous works and ideas on the subject:
- Jekaterina Suharenko, Conversations with the Water : Experiencing Life-Centered Design
- Marc Guntow and Ludwig Kannicht, Hybrid Work places
- Hugo Saksik: Hardware controllers for digital graphic design
- Samantha Zannoni: Create drawing tools

The EKA team led by Tanel Karp and Jekaterina Suharenko had prepared a precise and busy program: the methodological model was strongly inspired by a google sprint.
The main idea was to find an efficient and well-documented format to work together in a short time, combining creativity exercises, meetings and design workshops. Marc Guntow and Ludwig Kannicht are familiar with this type of format, and from the very first hours they provided exercises to form working groups by topic. Methodological tools were offered during the week to guide the students' responses.

For example, Marc introduced us to the *Four-Step Sketch* method, an exercise that helps people to create well-formed concepts through a structured process that includes:
- Reviewing key information
- Starting design work on paper
- Considering multiple variations
- Creating a detailed solution

### Talks and visits

The EKA team proposed meetings with designers, artists and visits to their workplace to build interviews and gather data for exploratory research in professional contexts. Each group went to talk about the topics identified in the previous sessions as well as more generic topics such as: how do you work and with what tools? Do you use pre-defined methods? How do you collaborate together and with external collaborators or clients?

They had a video call with Annie Abrahams and visited:
- TRINIDAD WISEMAN
- Pipedrive
- DUX

## Projects made by students

Introduction aux projets : comment se sont fait les groupes ? Quels étaient les objectifs de production ? Sur quoi ce sont-ils concentrés ? Comment ont-ils collaboré ? Comment on-t-ils présenté les résultats de la semaine ?

Once the material was gathered, the teams met to define their objectives and discuss the data collected.
Four topics were identified :
- social behaviour online, politics
- emotional bonds
- work/life balance
- motivation and creativity

We quickly realized that it was not reasonable to think of devices or software, we need to explore the subjects in depth and think about situations.
At the end of each days, teams made a presentation of their progress.

#### Emotional bonds

Emotional bond has a strong bond with creativity. The group is creating a social link about the rituals (individual, or social) #emotionalbond #privatespace #personalexperience. What is a ritual? Why is it important to share? 

The group has came up with an idea of the gardening app, wishing to connect to rituals theme. They have thought of what elements their product will consist of, who will use it, the user experience, prototyping interface design and user stories. Then, they did the prototyping and will develop the visualisation further.

They wanted to create a gardening community, where people can be alone and grow something together. The results would be shared between members of the community. The digital tool backs up the interpersonal relationships : how will it work? How will people feel that they are part of the community? How would it make sense? How to make it inclusive? They came up with a system free of hierarchy.

The group wants to make a prototype of how the platform will look like and what experiences it would create (interactive communication):
- Be in contact communication but without a tuff structure; 
- NFC scanner - to be sure that the person is present.

Gardening is about responsibilities so it is very important to be present. Scan the code, see who is gardening.

#### Motivation and creativity (music)

Audio is important. The sound is overlooked. What is the problem we want to solve? How to make it more personalised? How to add more personal interactions in the digital communication? It it the the theme (sound) that no one put a hard focus on. How to bring liveliness into the communication between the call participants during the call? #team #collaboration #sound
Who is it that you are designing for?
What is the context that you are designing in?

The project is aimed at push motivation while working in between study and work sessions, lectures. Many of us are deeply connected with sound. The group came up with jamming sessions. Using microphones. Musicians might have not this chance to enjoy digital collaborations since it might be strange to use digital tools. It is an opportunity to meet with different musicians. We tried to look whether there are any problems with the delay. The opportunity to have fun and bring creativity while using this tool. The group is going on a more gamified experience. They have watched some references for inspiration. Perhaps we will show the references tomorrow during the presentation. The groups says that they need to imagine the concept of visual interface who will use this tool to have a reflection about sound communication would that be with or without camera, chatting possibilities ot not. Sound is a way of communication. They have also done some wireframes to see what kind of elements they want to bring to this tool. Musicians \ non musicians. How to make it radically simple. When does the session start. What instruments it would be. Maybe you could be just alone, and decide who you want to allow to enter the space, who can see your jam. Live problem will be the problem of delay. We want to make the option of multiple people adding this sounds to already existing "music". What kind of instruments would there be. Simplified number of instruments. Grab the system. Basic premise? The tool would not be for a professional musicians since it would not maybe satisfy them. Perhaps musicians might create a library that other users can play with it. Going out of the design bubble who is interested to be in music. A tool for creatives. Express yourself freely without knowing how to use a real instrument.

#### Social behaviour online, politics

The issue was our misunderstanding on the reason we are here, together in this workshop. After this long discussion, and sharing the insights we gained from the interview realised that day with Annie Abrahams and Ülo Vihma, we voted on our ideas with a method called dotmocracy. We settled on the following theme : create a platform that adapts to different situations.

We came up that we want to create a platform of different formats (discussion mode, presentation mode, classroom mode). Defined who is who in the conversation and what role it has and who needs to be there. How we want to get feedback while the person is presenting. For example, emojis coming out when you agree or disagree. The way how people communicate during the pandemic has changed tremendously, people started using corporation platforms like zoom, google meets, slack etc, whereas before you could interact in the classroom.

Debates, one-one discussion, we wanted to ask what digital space can create while its not physical. what is people's role, what are the different characters, relationships, responsibility of actions. They wanted to create some features. How the users will interact with each other. The zoom umbrella, you are part of it as an individual as well as in the community. How do you represent yourself when you are in the digital space - for example open the camera mode. we started to think about other representation possible (for example, you can pick a color, a drawing, that will bring some expression). Because not everyone is comfortable to show themselves through video. We started to think about more experimental things for example sound.

We haven't talked about precise modes, maybe there might be switch modes. You could choose pre-settings (structure, default settings that will help you to be more engaged). It would be one tool where you can switch modes and the software could adapt to it. We haven't tested it yet. we had the experience with zoom during the lockdown. Discussions might not work really well. breakout rooms might not be the best solution. We have made an obligation to say goodbye, thank you for the lesson, switch your mice on. There are some things that are missing at the moment. There are things that are not possible to do in the digital space. It is two different mediums with specific elements. We took a distance, what do we actually need, how can we use those specifics to improve the experience. Put the existence during the digital space. We are identifying the context of social interaction, so we need to be careful to propose romantic context situation. It is an ethical questions that we need to think about. There are limits and problems that we need to ask ourselves. We haven't thought about graphic interface yet, but more what features there would be.

#### Work/life balance

The subject is work and life separation. The idea was to create a buddy that is connected to a calendar. 1st way to use the buddy is the computer that will inform you to make breaks. 2nd way is the physical cubes that you can interact with on a tactile level, that have different modes of work. As well as exercises to help with the stress. If you are stressed the app tracks it down and informs about it, reflects on your day, tells about your achievements. The buddy helps you not to burn out and organise your life in a more ecological way. 1) setting mode cube to enter your mood, your team, opportunity to check in to, while checking out - what you have accomplished and plan things for the next day. give you the opportunity to share between your buddies.

Next step is to create a storyboard how it will work like in a usual day. Its a two way communication to set things up - the app will give you advice on how to make you less stressed, encourage you to take a walk, get away from the screen (work time).

The question is who should be in charge to programme the buddy - a friend, a colleague, psychologist (who is behind the buddy).

How not to make it addictive, how to still listen to yourself. (notion of empowerment) reverse it and bring it back to the company. The data could be used in both ways.

Different varieties of analytics and reports. Personal data - interest problem. How the buddies can be the community of your friends discussing together and improving a way of working together.

The buddy was aimed at helping people not to overwork themselves.

### Conclusion and openings

What was the biggest interest in this workshop, was the meeting of our different approaches on tools, methods and projects. It was also what was the most difficult and tiring. We were actually surprised to see how different we were and it is now what we consider to be the strongest point of our collaboration.

However, with the hindsight we have today, we can say that if we were to do it again, we would make our differences in methods, perspectives on design and tools, the core of our first workshop together. We should not have underestimated this aspect of our collaboration that has been at the core of it.

But lets' get back to October 2021: after a week rich in experiences, discussions and thinking, each school returned to its country of origin. We had prepared a wiki to collect and document all the work, it is this tool we have enriched during the whole project and that we are using now for this publication. 

During the following months, each school included in their courses, the thinking and making of mock-ups, interfaces and prototypes based on what had been developed during that week in Estonia.
