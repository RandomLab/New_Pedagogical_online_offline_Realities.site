## What is the Digital Tools for Creative Collaboration project?

The Digital Tools for Creative Collaboration project is led by the Random(lab) of the Esadse in cooperation with the Eesti Kunstiakadeemia – Estonian Academy of Art, University of Design- Hochschule für Gestaltung Schwäbisch-Gmünd and the Bureau of European Design Associations (BEDA) as associated partner. 
The Project will involve students, teachers, technicians, members of theadministrative staff of these three HEI and will aim to:
* equip students, teachers and staff of the HEI in art and design with necessary skills and tools, creating future-proof conditions for digitalcreative cooperation
* through the critical approach, raise awareness on the data treatment challenges, including data security and ecological threats.

One doesn’t implement a European project alone. A minimum of three partners from three programme countries is one of the conditions for participation in the programme. It is also a great opportunity to work with international partners who share our questions about art and design education. For this project, the Esadse Random(lab) decided to turn to the Eesti Kunstiakadeemia - Estonian Academy of Art, University of Design- Hochschule für Gestaltung Schwäbisch-Gmünd  and the Bureau of European Design Associations as associated partner.
