## What is the Digital Tools for Creative Collaboration project?

The aim of this art and design oriented project is to involve teachers, students and staff of art and design schools into a common reflection on the issues raised by online collaboration for creative purposes, in particular through a critical prism and with the purpose to raise awareness on "good practices" as well as on the ecological impacts of these new working methods, the responsibilities related to data processing, data security, etc. It is also a great opportunity to work with international partners who share our questions about art and design education.

With the DTCC project, we aim to:
- build a critical thinking on the tools for collaboration we use within our schools.
- analyze the notions of collaboration, cooperation, contribution and participation in relation to art and design practices.
- collectively prototype tools for creative collaboration, that fits to our practices.
- conduct a research on the making of situated tools for collaborative projects by artists and designers.
- equip students, teachers and staff of the HEI in art and design with necessary skills and tools, creating future-proof conditions for digital creative collaboration.
- involve students as collaborators by involving them in each step of the project for pedagogical purposes.
- look at our own international collaboration situation as a case of study.

In order to achieve these goals, the consortium has or will:
- conduct exploratory research on collaborative digital practices in art and design higher schools.
- develop and test collaborative game, software and interface prototypes for the creative sector.
- create ourcollaborative.tools, a participatory online catalog of artistic collaborative projects based on digital tools that is available at: *url*.
- present the outputs of the project via three exhibitions, one in each of the partners schools.

Three intensive international workshops, milestones of the project, as also been organised in order to engage and involve all the interested participants into the making of DTCC. The work undertaken during those quick workshops, was often pursued during classes afterwards.
 
Several events have or will highlight the project results and allow us to reach out a larger audience:
- openschool.art professionnal meetings and its presentation inside *Le Monde Sinon Rien* exhibition during the Biennale Internationale Design Saint-Étienne 2022. openschool.art had a second edition organized by ENSAD Paris in March 2023.
- IxDA Seminar in EKA Tallinn.
- International Seminar Week (ISW) in HfG Schwäbisch-Gmünd.
- OpenOpen event in ESAC Cambrai.
