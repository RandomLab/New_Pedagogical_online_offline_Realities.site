## What is the purpose of this publication?

After two years of working together with the help of different sharing and communication tools, most of them already implemented in the our schools as google drive, zoom etc, but some installed and used for the project like yunohost, big blue button, nextcloud and a wiki that we build based on wiki.js, we gathered a lot of material, documentation, images in order to feed a publication that is deployed in a printed form as a pdf file, and a web form at the address *url*.

All the documentation and archive  was conceived from the start as an hybrid publication chain combining different formats and open source tools.

A certain fragility emerges from the contents gathered in this edition, both because our views have evolved over the course of exchanges, workshops and productions, on the subject but also on our methods. 
The editorial design was therefore done in stages and the texts were written by several hands.
