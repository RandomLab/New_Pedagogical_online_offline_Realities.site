## What is the purpose of this publication?

### We learn from experience

We learn from our experiences, and even more so from those that involve long-term collaboration.
The human factor is essential in design projects, a large part of a designer's work is done in a team, and a large part of our role is to support students so that they are able to collaborate in the best possible conditions.
This project, whose subject is creative collaboration, has also taught us to collaborate under difficult conditions (covid and post-covid time), in english, and with different cultural backgrounds. 
That's what we've tried to resume in this publication.

### A brief overview of what you will find in this publication

We have built this publication around the various activities and the associated productions that we have carried out over the past two years.

In the first chapter, *Methodologies and tools for collaboration*, we look back at the first workshop at EKA, where we got to know each other better.
Before, during and after this workshop, we tried to define all together the subject that we wanted to work, the state of the art and evaluate how to work together over the following months.

In the next chapter, The meeting of different approaches to teaching art and design in the digital age : each school presents its pedagogical positioning and the specific features of its program. We also discuss the *Openschool* event initiated during the project.

In *Learning to collaborate with people who have a different perspective*, we look back at the two workshops at Esadse and HfG where we explored creative collaboration strategies in greater detail. We also give the floor to the students, who understand a lot during the two year and learn from them.

Then, in *Designing tools for creative collaboration*, we continue to document our workshops at HfG and the design of the collaborative tools. We also feature two articles by researchers and the ourcollaborative.tools catalog that we start to build.

Finally, we present the three exhibitions that enabled us to showcase our work in each of our partner schools.
