## What is the purpose of this publication?

### We learn from experience

We learn from our experiences, and even more so from those that involve long-term collaboration. The human factor is essential in design projects, and much of a designer's work is done in a (often interdisciplinary) team. A large part of our role is therefore to support students so that they are capable of working in collaborative situations, even when they are not easy and fluid. The DTCC project, has indeed been an immersive experience into the topic of (digital) creative collaboration in which we became the main case study, being ourselves in a situation of working together under difficult conditions – covid and post-covid time, in english, and with different cultural backgrounds – that was rich in learning for students as well as for us teachers.

With this publication, we aim to narrate our story of collaboration between EKA, HfG and ESADSE as a starting point for a global reflection on our pedagogies. DTCC was a collective experience involving the teachers, students and staff of the three schools, which led us to question what we train students for as well as the tools – including methods – on which our teaching are based. Our collaboration has consisted of meetings, debates and collective productions, which have sometimes generated friction, encouraging us to question our assumptions and explore different perspectives on digital design practices and their teaching. For the students, this project has been a major opportunity to step out of their comfort zone, to position their practice within the broad spectrum of digital design and to collaborate with people who have different perspectives on the same discipline and other ways of conducting projects.

We have built this publication around the various activities and associated productions that we have carried out over the past two years and documented on a wiki we set-up dor the occasion. Those documents wrote by several authors including students, are used as a basis to tackle the topic of design collaboration from a pedagogical perspective.

### A brief overview of what you will find in this publication

In the first chapter, *Methodologies and tools for collaboration*, we look back at the first workshop at EKA, where we got to meet IRL for the first time and realized it was kind of utopic to think we could start collaborating without knowing well each other, our respective expectations and working habits. Before, during and after this workshop, we tried to better define all together the contours of our subject, build the state of the art and determine how to work together over the following months.

In the next chapter, *The meeting of different approaches to teaching digital art and design*, each school presents its pedagogical positioning and the specific features of its program. We also introduce the *openschool.art* professional meetings initiated during the project and dedicated to the issues at stake when teaching digital practices in art and design schools.

In *Learning to collaborate with people who have a different perspective*, we look back at the workshops at Esadse and HfG where we explored creative collaboration strategies. We also give the floor to the students, whose testimonies reveal what was at stake for them during those two years of collaboration.

Then, in *Designing tools for creative collaboration*, we keep documenting our workshops at HfG and present the interface and prototypes of the collaboration tools students made. We also feature two articles by designers whose work involve the making of tools and collective practices. We then introduce *ourcollaborative.tools* a platform we are currently building as an online and participative archive of artistic projects involving digital devices and collaboration.

Finally, *Making exhibitions as a collective and pedagogical practice* will discuss our intention of making three exhbitions of the DTCC project – one in each of the partner schools – and explicit the ways in which this work and the exhibition format is linked to our pedagogies.

We wish you a pleasant reading and hope our experience and reflections will echoe with yours.
