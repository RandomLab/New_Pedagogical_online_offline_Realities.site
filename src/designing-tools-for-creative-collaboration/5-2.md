**What do our tools look like when we create as a group of people at the same time on the computer?**

Personal computers are designed for exactly one person. Important human-machine interfaces such as the mouse or keyboard have long been established and their behaviour on the screen as mouse pointers or text cursors has changed only gradually over the last 50 years. But since the advent of web-based tools, we edit documents live together with others. Tools like Figma, Miro or Google Docs show us the presence of team members in real time on the screen. Is this already the end of development? What input patterns would be possible and useful?

In the workshop "Collaborative Interaction Patterns" Marc Guntow (HfG teacher) invited students to investigate input patterns in team situations and to visualise ideas with prototypes and simulations.


## Marc Guntow's Talks

During the first days of the week, each working session started with an introductive talk by Marc Guntow who is leading the workshop.

### A Brief History of Mouse Pointers

Mouse and Mouse Pointer have been around for a very long time. Famously they were introduced by Douglas Engelbart in his later so-called *Mother of all Demos*.

{% image "221121_collaborative_interaction_patterns_Page_008.jpg", "A Brief History of Mouse Pointers", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw" %}

Engelbart performed during the joint Computer Conference of the Association for Computing Machinery and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (ACM/IEEE) in San Francisco in 1968.

{% image "221121_collaborative_interaction_patterns_Page_009.jpg", "A Brief History of Mouse Pointers", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw" %}

The original title of his conference was: *A Research Center for Augmenting Human Intellect.*

Not only the mouse, but also the desktop metaphor, the videoconference, the conference call, the electronic mail and the hypertext system were displayed to the audience. That was in 1968. Engelbart's presentation was the first to publicly demonstrate all of these elements in a single system. The demonstration was highly influential and spawned similar projects at Xerox PARC in the early 1970s. The underlying concepts and technologies influenced both the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows graphical user interface operating systems in the 1980s and 1990s.

Computers go from text input to graphical input. Therefore a new input device was needed.

{% image "221121_collaborative_interaction_patterns_Page_012.jpg", "A Brief History of Mouse Pointers", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw" %}

Douglas Engelbart registered the patent for the first computer mouse in 1967. The device was still just a simple wooden box with two metal wheels and a single button.
The Rollkugelsteuerung was developed since 1965 under a contract from German air traffic control to mark aircraft positions on radar screens.
It was never used there, but as a peripheral device for Telefunken's mainframe, released in 1969. It was very expensive – 5.200 DM (10.300 € today).
They published the idea in a Telefunken magazine two months before Engelbart's Demo. A patent was applied for, but rejected due to "insufficient inventiveness".

But we do not want to talk about and work on hardware this week... But rather about their graphical representation and behavior.

## Morphology

The morphological box is a heuristic creativity technique after the Swiss astrophysicist Fritz Zwicky (1898-1974). For a given question, determining parameters are defined and noted vertically. Then possible expression for each parameter are noted horizontally. This creates a matrix which displays all possible solutions. Then for each parameter one expression is selected, resulting in a combination of expressions – one single solution.

## Storyboards

Storyboards are used to visualize screenplays and plan individual film scenes with sketch-like representations before shooting begins. The finished screenplay is translated into images for the first time in the storyboard and enriched with the concrete design such as perspective, viewing angle and size of settings.

The invention and use of storyboards dates back to Disney Studios. The storyboard is related to the comic strip in terms of structure and use as a visualization of narratives.

If we draw out storyboards for collaborative situations we would have to look at each user’s perspective separately.

## Interface, Action, Man-Machine-System

#### What is an interface?

- not a thing
- not touchable
- relationship betwenn user, tool and action
- the relationship of a user who, with the help of a tool (a hammer, a computer or a bank card), performs an action (hammer in a nail, create a drawing, manage money).

*"Design is the domain in which the interaction between user and product is structured to enable effective actions"* (Bonsiepe, 1996).

{% image "221121_collaborative_interaction_patterns_Page_095.jpg", "A Brief History of Mouse Pointers", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw" %}

#### Seven stages of action

Seven stages of action is a generalized model for user actions established by Donald Norman.

#### Man-Machine-System or (hu)man-machine-sytem

A a human-machine-system is the relationship between processes in a system that describes human activities to solve tasks with machines.

<figcaption>Interface, Action, Man-Machine-System</figcaption>

## Prototypes

#### Visual Prototype

A simulation that should come as close as possible to the desired result. In our case, a click dummy, a slide presentation or a video that visualizes your ideas.

You could use Keynote Magic Move – you have just seen this or the respective PowerPoint Morph Transition to create simple animated clips that display mouse pointer actions. More sophisticated animations can be done with Adobe After Effects or clickable prototypes with Figma (and smart animate).

#### Wizard of Oz Prototype

The name is taken from the 1939 musical fantasy film starring Judy Garland as the girl Dorothy from Kansas. Dorothy finds herself in the fantasy land of Oz and the only person powerful enough to bring her back home is the mighty wizard. At the end of the movie the wizard is revealed to be just an ordinary man, operating machinery that projects his ghostly image.

So, "Wizard of Oz" means that the technology is not here yet, but the experience is created through a clever deception – everything is operated manually in the background.

#### Proof of Concept Prototype

This is the opposite concept to a Wizard-of-Oz-Prototype. The main technical part works and can be evaluated, but visually everything is still rough or not yet designed.

## Projects made by students

### Authentic Emotion Capture in Digital Collaborative Working Spaces
#### Andy Parker, Nicole Krein, Kaisa Uik

{% image "IMG_5318.JPG", "Authentic Emotion Capture", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw" %}

#### What is this tool for?

In the digital collaboration era people tend to lack emotional connection in the workspace. They are working with computers rather the people using them. This tool makes it easier for co-workers to create emotional connections, it helps start conversations both about work and personal life and it lets you see authentic feedback of your work.

#### How does it work?

When you are viewing your co-worker's frame, motion capture system starts detecting your facial expressions. When you have a distinctive reaction a picture is taken of you and posted in the frames corner. You can add a comment to explain your recation or make a face with a stronger emotion to change it. You cannot delete your own reaction but others can.

#### What did we make?

Within four days we made a Figma file with different components that could be added to Miro or Figjam. We also recorded a video with three scenarios of the ways the tool could be used after drawing storyboards. In the end we made an explaining poster with pictures of scenarios.

#### What type of collaboration is it for (sychroneous/asynchroneous, collaborative/cooperative/participative)?

This is made as a new feature for digital collaboration tools like Miro and FigJam.

#### How does it impacts the collaboration?

Digital collaboaration is often very serious and it lacks emotional connection. With our solution people would give insight into their mood and working spaces. By making the workspace more intimate by creating an emotional connection between people. It also makes it less formal and more fun so people would feel less anxious and alone while working from distance.

#### How did we came up with this idea?

At first we came up with a few ideas which would be interesting to work with concerning digital collaboration and cursor qualities. We thought about gamification, making the work-space less formal and more connecting. We then defined the problem we see in digital workspaces – that people lack emotional connection that they usually have because they see face to face. We then started brainstorming about different ideas and stuck with the one where a picture is taken of you automatically to ensure authenticness.

<figcaption>Authentic Emotion Capture researchs</figcaption>

#### What other existing tools could it be compared to and why is it different?

The solution can be compared to the stickers feature because they also show what the other person is feeling. With our solution the reactions are real and authentical as you cannot fake them but whilst using stickers you can choose whatever reaction even if you don't feel that way. Seeing people's faces also makes you more familiar with them making it more comfortable to work.

<figcaption>FaceCursor final presentation</figcaption>

#### What is this tool for?

FaceCursor is a short program which come with a simulation of an interface, introducing a webcam into the mouse clicker. This tool could be used to reinvent the conception of video content using live, for example. On the other part, it would become an add-on to integrate to our operating systems, enabling us to get rid of a simple videochat software to move towards something between TeamViewer and Facetime (or the good ol' Skype). 

#### What type of collaboration is it for (sychroneous/asynchroneous, collaborative/cooperative/participative)?

This tool is obviously destined to a sychroneous collaboration, far away from an "emoji" or "thumb up" discussion... It could be also cooperative, if we imagine some additional features like drag'n'drop or clipboard action that involve a simultaneous user's clicking. For the moment, you have the possibility to draw directly on your "mouself", like a Paint extended to live webcam.

#### How does it impacts the collaboration?

FaceCursor clearly doesn't claim to be a huge innovation, the "cool" blending of several existing tools put apart. 

#### How did we came up with this idea?

The inspiration for this project came from our frequent use of Snap or Instagram filters, but also with this ability to move your face anywhere on the screen, when you are in a Facetime or Messenger call on a smartphone (or similar device). 

#### What other existing tools could it be compared to and why is it different?

The difference with an overknown tool like Miro or Figma is the add of the mouse pointer with live camera on integrated, and the ability to get a "real human" interaction with it.

## Autonomous mouse pointer
##### Nicole Krein, Héloïse Debrand, Ludovic Hohl

#### What if your mouse pointers were retired?

Thanks to the Leap Motion Controller, there is no more need for mouses or even for mouse pointers so they are now retired and living they're best life as autonomous pointers. Let's see what this one is busy doing in the background.

### Conclusion and openings
This week was productive in discussions, experiences and design. Many tools were modeled by students and figured a large variety of intentions that seek new ways of interacting with each others. We witnessed moments of skills and tools sharing in between the members of teams, which was really intersting in the way that the separation between our schools pedagogies went porous through students. 

During this third and final workshop week, we, the teachers, also got the chance to discuss about how to render all the work done. Different formats were considered to disseminate the work, we decided on an exhibition in each school but with similar content: video interviews of the students who participated in the workshops, with the same questions, that we collectively wrote. As we were in the context of the workshop, we were constantly having informal feedbacks on the workshops from students. We felt that – as they were the ones who were the most concerned by the work done and by our experience of collaborating together – we should give a place of choice to their testimonies and reflections on the subject of digital collaboration.
