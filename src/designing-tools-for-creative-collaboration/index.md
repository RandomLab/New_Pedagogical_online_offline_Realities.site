# Designing Tools for Creative Collaboration

In this chapter, our aim is to delve into our approach to designing
tools for creative collaboration within the context of our schools,
while also considering the perspective of professional designers. This
unique perspective provides valuable insights on how to prepare students
for their lives "beyond the classroom".

Firstly, we will revisit two workshops that took place at HfG Schwäbisch
Gmünd. These workshops specifically centered around the design of
alternative communication tools and their interfaces, such as [video-call
software](/designing-tools-for-creative-collaboration/5-1/) and [mouse pointers for simultaneous collaboration](/designing-tools-for-creative-collaboration/5-2/). As we
initially approached the topic of digital tools for collaboration in art
and design, our focus was on the tools utilized within our schools and
by professionals for remote collaboration, which became increasingly
prevalent during the pandemic when in-person meetings were not feasible.
These communication tools primarily fall within a broader category that
is not exclusive to the creative field, representing only a limited
spectrum of what currently exists and what could be imagined for
creative collaboration tools. Through our exploration of digital
technology within our own practices, we came to realize that while
improvements could certainly be made to these tools, what we truly
yearned for during times when physical meetings were not possible were
creative devices for collaboration and the ability to create together.

With the rise of international collaborations, telework, and remote
education, facilitating remote creative collaborations has become a
significant challenge and objective for digital product companies.
However, it\'s important to note that the exploration of online creative
collaborations predates lockdowns and has been an ongoing endeavor since
the advent of personal computers. This very issue forms the foundation
of the Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) culture, which
emphasizes collective practices of creating, improving, repairing,
maintaining, and forking tools.

Furthermore, many artists and designers, either through their
programming skills or in collaboration with programmers, are actively
opting to code their own tools as a means to break free from the
restrictions and costs associated with proprietary software. This
approach allows them to adopt a holistic perspective on technology,
which we believe holds significant value in teaching our students. The
second part of this chapter focuses on  [Nolwenn Maudet\'s insightful
reflection on the development of collaborative tools](/designing-tools-for-creative-collaboration/5-3/) created by graphic
designers as alternatives to proprietary software, with the aim of
overcoming creative limitations.

What emerges from these predominantly collective practices are often
context-specific tools. One particularly intriguing aspect of some of
these productions is their ambiguous status---they exist as both
artworks and tools. To provide further insights into the design practice
of creating tools for creative collaborations, we have included an
article by [designer Sarah Garcin, who shares her interactive and
collaborative experiences](/designing-tools-for-creative-collaboration/5-4/). This text will be featured on
[ourcollaborative.tools, an online platform that serves as a
participatory catalog of collective artistic digital projects](/designing-tools-for-creative-collaboration/5-4/). Designed
to be utilized, enriched, and refined by students, artists, designers,
and researchers alike, we will provide a comprehensive description of
the platform and its objectives at the conclusion of this chapter.
