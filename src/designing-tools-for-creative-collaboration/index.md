# Designing tools for creative collaboration

In this chapter, we aim to develop how we approached the topic of designing tools for creative collaboration in the context of our schools as well as from the ones of professional designers that offer an interesting perspective on how to prepare students for their "after-school" lives.

We first will look back at two of the workshops that happened at HfG Schwäbisch Gmünd, which focused on the design of alternative communication tools and their interfaces (video-call softwares and mouse pointers for simultaneous collaboration). When we first approached the topic of digital tools for collaboration in art and design, we focused on the tools used in our schools and by professionals to collaborate remotly, which became increasingly common during the pandemic when IRL meetings were not an option. Those are mostly communication tools that are not specific to the creative field and are part of a very limited spectrum of what is existing and what we could imagine when it comes to creative collaboration tools. By focusing on our own uses of digital technology, we realized that – even though those tools could be improved – what has been really missing us when we were not able to meet were creative devices for collaboration and the possibility to create together.

As international collaborations are becoming more and more common as well as telework and remote education, enabling people to create things together at a distance has become a major issue and goal for digital product companies. But tech companies are not the only ones to explore the complex topic of online creative collaborations and this has started way before lockdowns, since the begining of personal computers. This issue is actually at the basis of the FLOSS culture, which relies on collective practices of making, improving, repairing, maintaining and forking tools. 

Also, many artists and designers with programming skills or in association with programmers, are choosing to code their own tools to escape the restrictions and costs of the proprietary ones. In doing so, they have a holistic approach to technology that we think is valuable to teach our students. The second part of this chapter is dedicated to Nolwenn Maudet's reflection on the making of tools by and for collaboration, made by graphic designers as an alternative to proprietary softwares and their creative limitations. 

What emerge from those – mostly collective – practices, are often situated tools, made for a specific context. What is very interesting with some of those productions is their ambiguous status: they are both artworks and tools. An article of the designer Sarah Garcin will add an insight on how making tools for creative collaborations can be a design practice in itself. We asked her to tell us stories of her interactive and collaborative experiences. This text will be featured in the ourcollaborative.tools online platform which is a participative catalog of collective artistic digital projects. It is made to be used, filled and improved by students as well as artists, designers and researchers. We will fully describe it and its purposes at the end of this chapter.
