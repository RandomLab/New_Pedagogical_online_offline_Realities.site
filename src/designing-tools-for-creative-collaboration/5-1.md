## Let's kill zoom calls : HfG's workshop, 21-22 November 2022, Schwäbisch Gmünd (GE)

Florian Geiselhart, a computer scientist and former temporary professor
at HfG, played a significant role during the pandemic by creating
hfg.design 1.0, a teaching platform. Currently, he is actively working
on the development of the 2.0 version. Florian not only provides
technical guidance to students but also offers design support throughout
their projects.

### A quick overview of...

Florian discussed the tools we utilize for remote collaboration,
highlighting that most collaborative tools are designed for productivity
rather than creative work. We cannot deny the limitations of platforms
like Zoom when it comes to fostering true creative engagement. We can\'t
argue on Zoom.

We collected several thoughts regarding Zoom:

-   Communication is constantly active on Zoom, not on-off.
-   It enables us to be together despite physical separation.
-   What about non-verbal communication when we are not speaking?
-   Many conversations often happen simultaneously.
-   How can we share emotions and atmosphere, not just information?

Following that, we played a game to break the ice: Two truths and a lie.

## Making teams

Each student wrote down their thoughts on a piece of paper regarding the
various topics related to video calls discussed during the initial days.
Here is an excerpt of the ideas compiled:

<figcaption>Some notions on Miro</figcaption>

-   You can do your own break when working remotely.
-   You can\'t really assess how other person feels.
-   Non-verbal clues are important.
-   Feelings of closeness or distance to others depending on their
    location in the room is absent via Zoom.
-   Legs are hidden.
-   \"Synchronization\" between people when someone is talking, is
    easier to avoid speaking at the same time.
-   How to have a view on work progress of others?
-   Physical touch is missing.
-   Getting up to stick the post-it notes to an absent wall.
-   The truth/lie game wouldn't be so funny on Zoom.
-   Small chats in between meetings.
-   Smell of a room.
-   Sitting together.
-   Side-talks.
-   Seeing the emotions (gestures/mimics) of other participants that are
    not talking.
-   Rudimentary extra-class interactions.
-   Breaks (all at the same place) are missing.
-   Everyone would talk to each other's after a IRL meeting, not as a
    whole group.
-   Natural group-building.
-   Small talk.
-   Chilled atmosphere.
-   Eye contact.
-   Direct feedback because everyone is muted.
-   Work/life balance.
-   Being in the same environment/experience the same environment as the
    others.

After collecting our ideas, we formed the groups by deliberately mixing
the students, primarily based on their areas of interest as much as
possible.

### Teamwork

After first day ended, the rest of the week was dedicated to work on
teams\' projects that were presented at the end of the international
workshop week in HfG.

## Projects made by students

### Echo

##### Maëlys Bard, Alféa Morelli, Lars Dörper, Maximilian Becht

{% image "IMG_5292.JPG", "Echo", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw" %}

*echo* is a 2D virtual environment that allows users to move around in a
video-call space. We focused on the spatial and sonic aspect of group
work by imagining that it would be possible to move closer to the people
you want to listen to and further away from others rather than mutating
to simulate the sensation of sharing a space with other people. In echo,
users can interact with each other in many ways such as sharing a
presentation, activating magnetism to automatically follow the person as
they move, or teleport to each other. The idea of this project is to get
away from the strict and static aspect of the grid

#### Who is this tool for?

Our software can be used by creative teams that need to work remotely,
by groups of friends or by companies, mostly large groups.

#### What type of collaboration is it for (sychroneous/asynchroneous, collaborative/cooperative/participative)?

On *echo*, you can work alone while maintaining direct contact with your
colleagues, collaborate simultaneously as a team, or simply present your
work and hold meetings. It\'s a versatile tool that supports various
types of collaboration

#### How does it impact the collaboration?

We designed *echo* as a way to maintain a connection between
individuals, immersing them in the same environment to foster a sense of
closeness and unity, which are crucial elements in collaboration.

#### How did we come up with this idea?

First, in collaboration with other groups, we identified the problems
encountered with Zoom, as well as the elements we would have missed if
the first day of the workshop had taken place through video calls.

Our group focused on the following key aspects:

-   Non-verbal clues
-   Small talk/side talk
-   Sensing the vibe of the other collaborators
-   Local separation
-   Chilled atmosphere
-   Sharing the same environment/experiencing the same environment as
    the others

From those points, we arrived at the realization that the most effective
way to enhance the dynamism of a video call would be to introduce
movement. This led us to the decision of eliminating the grid entirely.
Applying the \"morphological grid\" method, we explored various
potential actions to break free from the constraints of the grid. This
exercise generated numerous ideas, and we had to carefully consider the
form our project would take for the final presentation three days later.

#### Why is it better than Zoom?

Unlike Zoom, which limits our sense of group formation by keeping us
stationary and removing the perception of spatial relationships with
others, *echo* offers a more human and interactive video-call
experience.

#### What other existing tools could it be compared to and why is it different?

*echo* shares similarities with Spatial Chat as both platforms employ a
sound spatialization system. However, *echo* distinguishes itself by
offering a more minimalist and sensitive approach. While Spatial Chat
attempts to replicate a sense of reality, *echo* focuses on creating the
sensation of being part of a team rather than just occupying a virtual
open space.

### eyesync

##### Leoni Stein, Enis Sentürk, Philipp Roser

First, we began asking ourselves why eye-contact was not working and why
it was necessary for us. Soon we found out that side conversations have
a huge impact on the authenticity of meetings.

#### Why we have no eyecontact during zoom calls

-   You see everyone at the same time
-   You look at yourself
-   You don\'t know if someone is looking at you
-   Every device has a different grid (of people)
-   Sometimes the camera is off

#### Why do we need it?

-   For direct feedback
-   For inclusion
-   For when you need to stay focused
-   For emotional connection
-   To feel spoken to
-   To feel heard

#### "How might we" questions

-   How might we make someone feel listened to?
-   How might we show two people that they look at each other?
-   How might we solve the problem of having side conversations without
    disrupting the host?

{% image "storyboard.png", "The planning of the workshop week in esadse", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw" %}


The technology we want to use is called eye tracking. For this we use an
API called *webgazer*.

### re.act

#### Roman Samarskyy, Sarah Fütterling, Tobias Reinhart

{% image "header.png", "re.act", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw" %}


#### What is this tool for?

*re.act* is an online meeting tool that enables participants to engage
in conversations based on their virtual location within a room. It
allows you to express your emotions and reactions to ongoing discussions
throughout the call.

#### Who is this tool for?

The tool is designed for any kind of project group, teaching situations
and teams that require simultaneous collaboration.

#### What type of collaboration is it for (sychroneous/asynchroneous, collaborative/cooperative/participative)?

It is for real-time collaborations.

#### How does it impact the collaboration?

It makes it easier to connect with other people in the room.

#### How did we come up with this idea?

The goal of the workshop was to reinvent digital communication and kill
a certain aspect of Zoom calls that was particularly annoying to most of
us.

We decided to focus on enhancing the ability to express reactions
because in a video call, it\'s challenging to convey your immediate
response to something that occurs during the call, unlike in a physical
room where others can hear your laughter or comments. We aimed to
provide a solution where participants can express their reactions
without disrupting the entire call or having them go unnoticed.

We began our project by collecting \'How might we\...?\' questions and
systematically deconstructing them. We started by asking ourselves,
\'Why do we want to do this?\' and continued to delve deeper by
answering the question and subsequently asking ourselves \'Why do we
want to do this?\' again. Additionally, we explored another perspective
by inquiring, \'What\'s stopping us from doing this?\' This approach
helped us identify and understand the underlying problems.

<figcaption>re.act, researchs</figcaption>

Finally, we were able to summarize our findings in the following
questions:

{% image "hmwfinal.png", "re.act, researchs", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw" %}


We then conducted competitor analysis by researching other tools that
allow users to send reactions.

{% image "competotor.png", "re.act, researchs", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw" %}

Most of these tools enable users to send emojis as reactions. We then
proceeded to analyze numerous emojis, aiming to identify the ones that
carry the most universally recognized meanings.

{% image "emojiclassification.png", "re.act, researchs", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw" %}

Since most emojis have multiple meanings and can be easily
misunderstood, we embarked on a process to determine the most important
ones and their specific applications. After extensive discussions, we
carefully selected a small set of reaction emojis that we identified as
crucial. These emojis are categorized into three groups: action,
reaction, and emotion. The final set is visually represented with a grey
frame.

{% image "emojiclassfinal.png", "re.act, researchs", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw" %}

The next step involved creating a concept that could be transformed into
a prototype. To achieve this, we developed a flowchart that illustrates
the process of sending reactions and provides an overview of how our
digital meetings function.

{% image "flowchartconcept.png", "re.act, researchs", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw" %}

Then we sketched out first ideas of what our interface and reaction
process could look like visually.

{% image "sketch3.png", "re.act, mockup", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw" %}
<figcaption>re.act, mockup</figcaption>

Our result is an online meeting tool that allows you to move freely in
the room and therefore to pick a seat and seat neighbors. You can talk
to the people you sit close to and hear those further away too but more
muted.

{% image "seat.png", "re.act, interface", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw" %}

You can send reactions to a specific person, a group of people or the
whole room depending on where you drop the emoji after you dragged it
out of your selection.

{% image "bildschirmfoto_2022-12-03_um_17.26.40.png", "re.act, interface", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw" %}

You can receive reactions as well, and like any other tool it allows you
to do all that while listening to a presentation or watching a shared
screen.

#### Why is it better than Zoom?

It offers a superior experience compared to Zoom as it closely mirrors
the dynamics of an in-person meeting. With numerous opportunities to
choose your actions, such as selecting your location in the virtual room
and deciding with whom you interact and share your reactions, it
provides a more immersive and realistic meeting environment.

#### What other existing tools could it be compared to and why is it different?

The tool uses all of the basic features that Zoom offers too but has
extensions that are connected to the real world. It is similar to the
app \"wonder\" which lets people walk to different places and chose
their talking partners as well.
