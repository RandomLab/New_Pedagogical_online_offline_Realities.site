## Digital Tools for Creative Collaboration: Logbook

### On the train from Paris to Karlsruhe

Here I am on the train, on my way to Karlsruhe, Germany. I am going
there to give some classes with Raphael Bastide[^1] at the University
of Fine Arts and Design[^2]. We decided to be cheerful and named our
seminar[^3] "A party to print", imagining a festive atmosphere while
preparing a new publication. We prepared nothing, so we have no idea
about the outcome, and we don't necessarily want to predict. We will
create this experience together with the students.

When they ask me, "And you? What do you do?", I don't answer plainly, "I
am a graphic and interaction designer", which most of the time signifies
nothing for the people I am interacting with. Instead, I try to explain
a current project I am working on. I should say, "I am doing a seminar
called "A Party to Print" in Karlsruhe". Then, I can talk about
horizontal learning, collaborative projects, creating and using open
source tools, alternative ways of publishing, experimenting, cooking,
and savior syndrome, search for meaning in life.

Rather than presenting my extensive theories on Digital Tools for
Creative Collaboration, I prefer telling you five experiences of
"working together" based on tools designed for digital collaboration (or
not); that made us feel useful (or not), happy (or not), angry (or not).
Most importantly, they made us think while doing and do while thinking.
Each of these experiences, in its own way, questioned the various ways
in which the introduction of collaborative digital tools modifies human
relationships and our ways of working together in a defined context. At
times, these experiences have exposed us to the limitations of our
tools. However, the totality of these narratives shows that successes
and failures are never due to the tool itself, but to the way it is
being utilized, presented, introduced, and shared. They depend on the
tacit agreement among the parties involved in using the tool and the
objectives established together (or not).

### Berne Museum of Natural History

We have just spent the entire night at the office of Museum of Natural
History in Bern, Switzerland; printing, folding and binding 100 copies
of the publication called *Frankenstein Revisited. *We are doing an art
residency since couple of days at the museum with Piero[^4],
James[^5], Anne[^6], Catherine[^7] et An[^8] accompanied by
stuffed animals[^9]. We[^10] were invited for the festival called
*Mad Scientist *organized by Roland Fisher. Piero, James, Anne,
Catherine and An came with their chatbots[^11] inspired by the book
*Frankenstein*; or, The Modern Prometheus by Mary Shelley[^12]. On my
side, I preferred Publishing Jockey Machine[^13] (or PJ Machine), a
real interface connected to a web program, developed for the occasion.
The project consists of creating a publication in three days, including
the group in the whole creative process (writing, iconography, layout,
printing and binding). The content will be the discussions with
chatbots, contextual texts in the form of letters[^14] and photographs
taken in the museum. After a discussion, we agreed as a group on the
basic principles of publishing (format, binding, chaptering and
planning). I set up a local shared folder which will include all the
content organized in folders. Each folder represents a double page of
publication; each is free to add a content; text or image. Any computer
connected to the *PJ Machine* functions as a workstation for the layout.
I created a simple graphic charter: one size and one typography for the
text, one size and one typography for the titles. All the rest is done
by *PJ Machine*. This box with the big arcade buttons works like a
control keyboard. Each button has a designated function. It is possible
to relocate texts and images, increase or decrease the space between
words, mix images together or highlight recurring words. Each member of
the group lay out their texts once they have been completed. *PJ
Machine* is very simple to use however it uses interactions we are not
quite used to, which causes some lucky graphic accidents. Concentration
is at maximum during the layout. (see image: 04-pjmachine_in-use2.jpg).

When you are satisfied with the outcome, a button allows you to export
it in PDF format, ready for printing. The group members take turns using
*PJ Machine *and double-page spreads are exported in a random order. We
print all the completed PDFs (resulting in total 55 double-page
spreads). We place them on the floor to put them on order. And finally,
we see the publication in its entirety.

Each of us participated in every stage of the edition's creation
process, however only in certain parts. Publication seems like an
organized and coherent piece. I am compiling a final pdf for print.

The week ends with the opening of *Mad Scientist Festival. *We watch a
ballet of stuffed animal drones and drink mojitos prepared by a robot.
We experimented, had a good laugh, and we are delighted to have done
this work together.

### Château de Cerisy-La-Salle

We are on the last day of the conference named *Art, Literature and
Social Networks[^15]* at Château de Cerisy-La-Salle, and it's time
to debrief. We gather together at the great hall of the castle. The
question is quite simple: "What did you think of the conference?". The
first person intervenes, criticizing strongly the *DONC* experience.
"What an idea to propose a digital project connected to internet in such
a place, in the middle of nature, where there is hardly any WiFi or 4G.
We could have been entirely disconnected. But instead, we found
ourselves trapped in a digital experiment, faced with this one hacker
who ruined the week for us."[^16] For an hour or so, all conversations
revolved around this. They attacked me, Raphaël[^17] and Louise[^18]
as much as they attacked the hacker. I discretely rejoice over the
results of our experiment. We had wanted to create a social network
during this week. Over the course of five days, we have seen all the
awkward situations possible that come with social networking and online
open participation. Images shared without consent, trolling, anonymity,
identity theft, spam, even a complete hack of the system, which resulted
in an absolute anger among the participants. We created a collaborative
system of misery.

We arrived to the castle of Cerisy-La-Salle in the beginning of the week
to participate in the conference named *Art, Literature and Social
Networks. *When I say, "we", I talk about the participants, artists and
academics. The place is incredible. Raphaël, Louise and me, we came here
with a special task in head for this week: to build up an experimental
documentation system for the conference, enabling the creation of an
almost real-time publication. Beforehand, we decided to create a tool
based on a mailing list, and we called it *DONC*. All content sent by
e-mail to this list is received by all the subscribers and is
automatically added to a web page formatted in HTML and CSS[^19],
serving as a basis for publication. Every half-day, we print the new
pages for the publication. We display them on large tables in a crowded
room (which also serves as the cocktail area). We provide pens, duct
tapes, markers, pencils etc. ready for manual commentary to be written
in these pages. The pages are then scanned with a smartphone to create a
printable PDF.

It's the first day of the conference and we present our project. All
participants are registered by default on the mailing list of *DONC*,
nothing is mandatory, if someone doesn't wish to participate, we remove
them from the list. Two or three people decide to not participate.
Fairly soon after, the publication fills up, and emails pour in. Images
from conference are sent in, as well as short texts, jokes, riddles,
long texts, text of the previous presentation and so on. All the
subscribers participate actively. Printed pages are filled with
comments, with words that are crossed out, pieces that are cut out and
crushed. In the evening, when the cocktail hour is well underway, we
find ourselves surrounded by half-witted jokes. On the second day, some
of the e-mails seem to be encrypted and the Cerisybot[^20] appears.
The publication continues to be filled up with making-of images, photos
of Cerisy, advices and generated texts. On May 24, the Cerisybot sends
another e-mail with a subject line called "«\[VIRUS\] I \<3 YOU".

Identity thefts start to appear. Some emails are sent from the email
addresses of participants who are not the actual authors. This leads to
a few tensions. More spam texts arrive in the evening of May 24^th^, and
we receive the same emails multiple times. An image of a train, a text
that begins with \"Queen of Egypt, goddess of Nubia,\" and some others.
These e-mails are completely anonymous. On the morning of May 26^th^,
all *DONC *participants wake up to find their e-mail inbox full of spam.
Rumors circulate that there is a hacker within the group, and a few
individuals are suspected and even denounced. One of the participants
storms into the breakfast room, furious, with his computer under his
arm, saying, \"You broke my computer!\" I examine the so-called
\"broken\" computer, and its email inbox is full; the user has never
emptied the trash. I empty the trash, and just like that, it\'s fixed.
Without a \"thank you\" and still furious (probably his ego bruised by
his technical incapacity), he leaves, slamming the door, and we don't
see him again.

But who is this hacker?

Tensions rise.

Between May 25th and May 26th, the mailing list receives an email that
causes the DONC system to crash. Tired of the complaints and criticism
regarding the experience, we decide to stop it, claiming that the system
is irreparable. From a small study room in the castle stables, Raphael,
Louise, and I send an email to the *DONC* mailing list:

Dear participants,

DONC system has been hacked, we regret to inform you that the experiment
ends now. After this email, you will be unsubscribed from the mailing
list, and your emails will no longer be addressed by DONC.

You will be kept informed of the project's evolution.

We thank you for your (very) active participation, which contributed to
the success of this project.

The DONC team

We take advantage of this interruption to finalize the publication,
print it, and bind it. It will remain printed in a few copies that will
never be distributed[^21].

### Gaîté Lyrique, Paris

I'm sitting at the counter of the bar of *Gaîte Lyrique *in Paris.
Romain[^22] et Anne[^23] arrive with middle schoolers from the
cooperative school of Collège Jean-Pierre Timbaud in Bobigny. They are
here to present the project they have worked on together during the
year. Lyna, Ambre and Christelle[^24] present « *Chépa, Le Journal
Pour Tou.te.s » *imagined, written, illustrated and laid out by the
students of the class. The presentation ends with a distribution of the
journal, and the students, proud of their work, run throughout the
building and into the street to offer what they have created.

Since 2015, with Pauline[^25] and Louis[^26], under the title of
\"l\'Atelier des Chercheurs[^27],\" we are developing, among other
things, a software called do•doc (pronounced doudoc). Designed to
document and create narratives from practical activities, do•doc is a
composite, free, and modular tool that allows you to capture media
(photos, videos, sounds, and stop-motion), edit them, lay them out, and
publish them. Its composite nature allows it to be reconfigured to be as
well-suited as possible to the situation in which it is deployed.
"do•doc" includes a local software version and an online version. It has
been built using web languages, specifically utilizing tools that enable
real-time collaboration such as Node.js[^28], Electron[^29], and
Socket.io[^30].

With the intention of building this software in specific contexts, we
conduct workshops in educational institutions to test the software and
add features based on identified needs.

The project started with the students of Jean-Pierre Timbaud Middle
School on September 19, 2018. We meet approximately once a week to
collectively create a journal from A to Z, exploring the themes of the
Computer Grrrls[^31] exhibition. With Anne and Romain, the two
teachers supervising the project, we decided to apply a horizontal
pedagogy, a guided laissez-faire approach. We did not impose any
decisions, as everyone was responsible and an organizer in their own
right.

The first workshops are dedicated to discussion and debate. The floor is
given to the students. For each discussion, there are two volunteers:
one facilitates the conversation, while another takes notes on the
board. I ask them fundamental questions: what type of sexism do you
experience as teenagers? Are your extracurricular activities
gender-biased? Can you mention any movies, video games, or music that
you find sexist?

But also technical and logistical questions: What is a journal? What
content should be in the journal? What topic should be chosen? How do
you organize you work? How many copies should be made? How do we
distribute it? What should we name it?

Starting with these conversations, three groups are formed around three
themes: street harassment, gender in professions, and girls in video
games. The students begin writing the articles on do•doc in small
groups. All of this takes place in the computer room equipped with old
Windows computers and a questionable internet connection. do•doc is used
locally, and all the computers are connected via Wi-Fi to a central
computer that acts as a server. This way, all the content is gathered in
one place, offline.

All decisions are made as a group. We discuss the layout, with each
group advocating for their ideas, and compromises are reached. One
session is dedicated to creating photo illustrations in the school and
in the streets of Bobigny with Frédéric Danos, while another session
focuses on building a a do•doc[^32] station at the fablab of
*Carrefour du Numérique de la Cité des Sciences *(Paris). The final
sessions (a bit chaotic due to the temperamental computers) are
dedicated to the layout of the articles on do•doc, allowing all
participants to finalize the journal together.

Despite the technical difficulties related to the outdated equipment in
schools, the challenges of managing a group of teenagers, disagreements,
laziness, the extended timeline of the project, fatigue, insults, and
spelling mistakes, we collectively managed to create this journal,
printed in 1000 copies.

### Lorient

Since March 29, I've been in Lorient at EESAB[^34] for a
web2print[^35] with Roman[^36]. It's Wednesday, which means it's
time for the "matinale", an improvised and experimental radio show that
takes place live and in public from 7am to 9am at the Vanilla
café[^37] in Pré-Saint-Gervais (93). I have been co-hosting this show
with dns and hrbr for nearly three years. However, today I am in
Lorient. I scheduled a meeting at 7am with strd, rmn, and clr[^38] at
the corner of the street near my hotel. It\'s still dark outside. I
start the audio streaming application on my mobile phone. The microphone
of my phone captures the ambient sound and sends it (streams) to my
mount point on the IceCast[^39] server of ∏Node[^40]. My live stream
\"goes up\" and appears on the homepage of p-node.org. jdsk, comfortably
settled at her home, can listen with a 15-second delay[^41] to the
audio stream broadcasted by my phone and mix it with the live audio
stream produced at the same time by dns, hrb, and their guests from the
temporary radio studio at Vanilla Café. It\'s 7 am, and my phone calmly
captures the ambient sound of the quiet streets of Lorient while strd
and rmn grab a takeaway coffee. We start our stroll, heading towards the
fishing port. Our destination is the sandwich shack that\'s open at all
hours, and perhaps we\'ll have the chance to interview some fishermen
who stayed a little late at the fish market. 500km away, at the Vanilla
Café, a lot is happening, but we are clueless since we don't listen to
it. We blindly participate in a sound mix, and we don't need necessarily
to worry about this collaboration; chance takes care of things for us,
helped by our jdsk on the mixing tables. We do as we please, at two
distinct points, to create a whole. A kind of altruistic selfishness.

The smell of industrial shrimp from the frozen products factory
accompanies us during the walk. We discuss, comment, interview, and
describe. We finish the two-hour broadcast at La Base, the nautical port
of Lorient.

So, this live morning show, broadcasted from Lorient and Le
Pré-Saint-Gervais, acts like a cloud carved by the wind and returns
home, it slides like words flowing through the airstream, like something
messing up your hair when you\'re asleep and dreaming of having your
hair done, mixed by jdsk, hosted by grcn, hrbr, dns, and accompanied by
their guests.

Epilogue: To listen to this show, you can visit the website of Radio PSG
Matin or go directly to the following link:

There, you will find the recording of the morning show that took place
on March 29, 2021, along with other similar radio experiments that have
occurred at Radio PSG Matin.

## November 9, 2022

### On the train from Saint-Étienne to Paris

Last night, at the auditorium of ESADSE[^43], I gave a conference
entitled \"Long-Distance Relationship (or Not).\" This talk aimed to
explore the question of collaborative digital tools operating in the
same time and space, usually functioning offline. For this conference, I
used a tool called baking.js[^44]. It was designed and developed in
2015 with Angeline[^45] for the ELIF seminar at ENSBA[^46]. This
tool was created to facilitate collaborative presentations involving
multiple speakers. It allows for real-time manipulation of media and
text across multiple devices (computers, tablets, smartphones). Its
functionality is inspired by a stack of images that can be browsed and
explored, enhanced with digital features such as zoom, fullscreen
display, and hypertext. baking.js also allows the audience to connect to
the application through a local network and contribute to the conference
by adding texts or images. Thus, I tested this participatory system for
the first time yesterday as part of the \"Digital Tools for Creative
Collaboration\" project. At the beginning of the conference, I invited
the students present in the room to connect to the Wi-Fi and visit the
provided IP address to comment, hack, troll, make live suggestions, and
interact with the presentation. In less than a minute, the presentation
is disrupted, the images prepared for the conference are moved to
different corners of the page, memes or images generated by AI are added
on top. A sound recording plays in a loop. The presentation is
completely trolled[^47] from the start. The audience is destabilized.
The public continues these disruptions sporadically throughout the hour
and a half of the presentation, without ever discussing their
contributions. When I ask, \"What is this? Do you want to talk about
it?\" There is no response (perhaps I didn\'t insist enough). Some
collaborations seem political, such as capturing an article about the
potential misappropriation of funds by the former director of the Cité
du Design, or a text titled \"A €1.4 million hole in the budget of the
Cité du Design." In the end, I proposed an anonymous collaborative tool
where all contributions are anonymous. The first contribution was
disruption, making it difficult for the presenter with jokes, and
trolling. There were political claims without any clear stance, letting
the media speak on their behalf. Does anyone take responsibility
IRL[^48]? Does anyone openly discuss these issues? Everything seems to
occur online, and I continue with my presentation. Is this what true
participation looks like? Is this what it means to collaborate? Is this
what it means to create common resources together? Is this the essence
of sharing knowledge? Perhaps the problem lies in my role as an expert
speaking alone to an audience, adopting the position of a teacher
addressing students.

An uprising against a certain authority, a \"hey, look at me, I\'m here
too,\" diverting attention, disrupting focus.

Perhaps this initial reaction is linked to our digital usage, both as
consumers and producers of content.

However, baking.js was designed to be participatory, blurring the line
between the stage and the audience, with the goal of engaging the
audience in the presentation. It encourages daring interruptions, adding
images, and provoking debates and discussions. In the face of trolling,
wouldn\'t it be necessary to interrupt the presentation and encourage
discussion and comments? Does this align with the true essence of
collaboration? Is a misunderstanding equivalent to a quid pro quo?
