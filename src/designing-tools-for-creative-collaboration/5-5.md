## ourcollaborative.tools

Within the framework of the DTCC project, we wanted to make a publication as a tool, that would serve us over the long term; a device that would be a synthesis of our research in Esadse, made in collaboration and that could be useful for designers, artists, students and academics.

We first envisionned a toolkit but finally imagined a platform that would be both an online design research publication, a participatory archive and a pedagogical tool. We named it ourcollaborative.tools.

This platform aims to be used by designers and artists – students or professionals – who work on notions such as collaboration, cooperation, contribution, participation, creative process, free software (FOSS), computer development and visual arts. 

All the projects listed in this catalogue contribute to the building of commons, through digital artistic devices. The artists and designers who implement them are – all in their own way – shaping frameworks to host collaborations (with peers, experts from other disciplines, a classroom, inhabitants of a territory, other than humans, etc.). We are mostly interested in the ambivalent status of those productions that are both artworks and tools.

However, we do not only aim to archive projects but also to document collective practices and study how artists and designers use, combine, fork, existing tools and develop new ones, so they can fit to their working methods and not the way around. For this purpose, a collection of articles and a mediagraphy will add a critical perspective on the subject of digital collaboration and the – always collective at some point – making of situated tools for artistic purposes.

This participatory archive – by interconnecting projects and articles through shared notions and datas – is designed to act as a connector between artworks, stories of creative processes, theory and critical thinking. 

We are continuously working on its design and editorial structure and we will continue for some time. With a small team and through workshops, we would like to push this object as far as possible in order to really make it a tool that could be used for several purposes. This project is in progress, here is an abstract of our intentions and testing for ourcollaborative.tools.

### What's inside?

#### Projects

Each project is presented in the form of a sheet that provides the title, description, year of creation if it exists, the author(s), a link to the source, usage, temporality, and a technical environment. [+ on hésite à ajouter : licence et (sélection) outils utilisés => We are still thinking about other relationships and objects like tools, licenses, languages]

Notions are associated with each project, in connection with the articles. [+ infos sheets (date, auteur...) comme liens aussi]

#### Articles

[We invited several academics and practicioners to enlighten us on their visions of creative collaboration : we asked them to write an article as close as possible to their sensibilities to have the most precise view on our subject. Projects and concepts are associated with their text to create a fine relationship with the content of the catalog.]

#### Notions

[We wish to enrich the plateform with a lexicon of notions related to the subject: each notion is defined to be as accurate as possible. Several relations can be create from and to the articles and projects]

#### Ressources

We want this catalog to be as rich as possible. As we won't be able to publish a large amount of texts for financial reasons and to enhance the research we have made in the context of this project, we thought about adding a mediagraphy. It will feature references of articles, books, websites, etc. which will enrich the content by giving multiples perspectives on the subjet of digital tools for collaboration in art and design practices. We will feed this library with suggestions from guest authors, students and teachers involved in the project as well as outside contributors.

We are building this mediagraphy on the APA model to ensure its compatibility with current research norms and academic formats.

#### Images

We have chosen to leave a large part to the images, in order to give wide spaces for interface illustrations and screenshots of indexed projects. This decision has been made to value their formal design. Regarding the articles, we would also like the texts to be generously illustrated to continuously link practice to theory.

### How is it built?

We invited Benjamin Dumond from Bonjour Monde studio. As a graphic and interaction designer, Benjamin built the website graphic identity as well as the logic behind the interface. Since we consider ourcollaborative.tools as a design object in itself, we decided on a strong and singular identity.

We then worked together on the design of the user experience. The development as well as the editorialization is ensured by our Random() team, in order for us to be able to make it evolve and maintain it over the following years.

ourcollaborative.tools is made in two parts :

At first, the back office is built on the Django framework and consists of a Rest API that publishes all content in JSON format, which enables us to build other graphical applications from the same data. Django is adapted for content-rich platforms and can be resized according to evolutions.

Then, the frontend is based on vue.js which gives us a lot of adjustment possibilities during the multiple testings and allows quick corrections.

The database system is still under developpement mode and will migrate to a PostgreSQL database soon.
All is based exclusively on free softwares including the interface design made with Inkscape and of course, the development of the platform (django and vue).
All the sources will be in open-access a posteriori.

### How to use it?

The platform is designed to create a maximum of relationships between the different objects it is constituted of. The general idea is to offer as much variations as possible to explore the content. It is also inteded to become a participatory archive you will be able to contribute to.

#### Explore

[sujets, types de contenus à explorer, une base de donnée riche]

The entire platform is built on the relationships between content, it is also more symbolically a community of creators motivated by the idea of ​​creative collaboration.

It is possible to approach the content in different ways:
- by the index of all the projects with a focus on images
- by a search with occurrence in the different objects (projets, notions, articles)
- by the relationship between notions, articles, projects and authors.

A range of filters allows you to shuffle the data to navigate through the information.

[les projets et articles sont interconnectés de pultiples façons, find your own path]

#### Participate

We will feed the platform initially by our solicitations to the creators and researchers, from our network to an active research of projects but we are thinking about a way to make it a more open participative tool.

[Question modération, participation guidelines => assurer cohérence éditoriale/curatoriale]

### What will come next?

From the begining, ourcollaborative.tools as been thought to be a education tool we could use in our schools, so the first thing to come next will be testing it with students. 

We first intent to use it for research work, by exploiting its potential as a participative archive with contents to explore as well as to nourrish. 

It is also a constantly evolving tool we would like to improve with their involvment with both technical and editorial perspectives.

Then, as a data-base and thanks to interoperability, we could imagine giving it many different forms (web-to-print publciations, exhibitions, etc.). We would like to explore these possibilities with students, through collaborative curatorial and design projects.

It is very important to us that his platform doesn't become a static archive but remains a material that can be shaped, in constant process. To this end, ourcollaborative.tools will pass form hand to hand, grow, mutate and be forked through classes and workshops.
