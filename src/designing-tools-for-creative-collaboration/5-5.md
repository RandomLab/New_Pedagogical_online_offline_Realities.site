## ourcollaborative.tools

Within the framework of the DTCC project, we wanted to make a publication as a tool, that would serve us over the long term; a device that would be a synthesis of our research in Esadse, made in collaboration and that could be useful for designers, artists, students and academics.

We first envisionned a toolkit but finally imagined a platform that would be both an online design research publication, a participatory archive and a pedagogical tool. We named it *ourcollaborative.tools*. It figures a catalogue of collective artistic projects involving digital tools, that are situated responses rather than generic solutions and articles that provide critical thinking in order to explore alternative use and making of creative collaboration devices.

This platform aims to be used by designers and artists – students or professionals – who work on notions such as collaboration, cooperation, contribution, participation, creative process, free software (FOSS), computer development and visual arts.

All the projects listed in this catalogue contribute to the building of commons, through digital artistic devices. The artists and designers who implement them are – all in their own way – shaping frameworks to host collaborations (with peers, experts from other disciplines, a classroom, inhabitants of a territory, other than humans, etc.). We are mostly interested in the ambivalent status of those productions that are both artworks and tools.

However, we do not only aim to archive projects but also to document collective practices and study how artists and designers use, combine, fork, existing tools and develop new ones, so they can fit to their working methods and not the way around. For this purpose, a collection of articles and a mediagraphy will add a critical perspective on the subject of digital collaboration and the – always collective at some point – making of situated tools for artistic purposes.

This participatory archive – by interconnecting projects and articles through shared notions and datas – is designed to act as a connector between artworks, stories of creative processes, theory and critical thinking. 

We are continuously working on its design and editorial structure and we will continue for some time. With a small team and through workshops, we would like to push this object as far as possible in order to really make it a tool that could be used for several purposes. This project is in progress, here is an abstract of our intentions and current work for *ourcollaborative.tools*.

### What's inside?

#### Projects

Each project is presented in the form of a sheet that provides the title, description, year of creation if it exists, the author(s), a link to the source, usage, temporality, the technical environment and pictures of the project. We are still thinking about other entries we could add, like tools used to make it, licenses, and programming languages.

Notions are also associated with each project as tags that connects them with articles related.

#### Articles

We invited several academics and practicioners to tell us about their visions of creative collaboration through the filter of their own professional experience. We asked them to write a text as close as possible to their sensibilities to build a corpus of situated articles, in relaion to our subject. These texts are either stories of projects presented from a critical perspective, or theoretical texts linked to the authors' research work. 

Projects and notions are associated with each text, in order to create an ecosystem of relationships inbetween the various contents *ourcollaborative.tools* is composed of.

Here is a shortlist of the contributions we know for sure will be published in *ourcollaborative.tools*:

- Garcin, S. (2023). Digital Tools for Creative Collaboration: Logbook.
- Maudet, N. (2023). Appropriate to Better Share: Digital tools for Design Collaboration.
- Mertens, A. (2023). Holding Space for Discomfort in Collective Work: A Potential Role for Trees.
- ooooo (2023). [unknown title: article about feminist servers and federation].

Some more articles will be added later on.

#### Notions

We intend to enhance the plateform with a lexicon of notions related to our topic of research. Each concept will be accompanied by its definition, in order to create a common vocabulary base, with the aim of opening it up to a non-initiated audience.

This index of notions will also be used to filter searches: each concept can be clicked on to open a list of associated projects and articles.

#### Ressources

We want this catalog to be as rich as possible. As we won't be able to publish a large amount of texts for financial reasons and to enhance the research we have made in the context of this project, we thought about adding a mediagraphy. It will feature references of articles, books, websites, etc. which will enrich the content by giving multiples perspectives on the subjet of digital tools for collaboration in art and design practices. We will feed this library with suggestions from guest authors, students and teachers involved in the project as well as from outside contributors.

We are building this mediagraphy on the APA model to ensure its compatibility with current research norms and academic formats.

#### Images

We have chosen to leave a large part to the images, in order to give wide spaces for interface illustrations and screenshots of indexed projects. This decision has been made to value their formal design. Regarding the articles, we would also like the texts to be generously illustrated to continuously link practice to theory.

### How is it built?

We invited Benjamin Dumond from Bonjour Monde studio. As a graphic and interaction designer, Benjamin built the website graphic identity as well as the logic behind the interface. Since we consider ourcollaborative.tools as a design object in itself, we decided on a strong and singular identity.

We then worked together on the design of the user experience. The development as well as the editorialization is ensured by our Random() team, in order for us to be able to make it evolve and maintain it over the following years.

*ourcollaborative.tools* is made in two parts :

At first, the back office is built on the Django framework and consists of a Rest API that publishes all content in JSON format, which enables us to build other graphical applications from the same data. Django is adapted for content-rich platforms and can be resized according to evolutions.

Then, the frontend is based on vue.js which gives us a lot of adjustment possibilities during the multiple testings and allows quick corrections.

The database system is still under developpement mode and will migrate to a PostgreSQL database soon.
All is based exclusively on free softwares including the interface design made with Inkscape and of course, the development of the platform (django and vue).
All the sources will be in open-access a posteriori.

### How to use it?

The platform is designed to create a maximum of relationships between the different objects it is constituted of. The general idea is to offer as much variations as possible to explore the content. It is also inteded to become a participatory archive anyone will be able to contribute to.

#### Explore

With *ourcollaborative.tools*, our ambition is to create a rich database of content to explore. The platform is designed so that each element is interrelated with the others. 

Content can therefore be browsed in a number of different ways:

- The entry page will be the index of projects and will emphasis on pictures. As well as the "Articles", "Authors", "Notions", and "Media" pages, it will open to a list of the contents of each category.
- Every element is described with associated datas such as date of creation, usage, temporality, etc that are also filters. Each one can be clicked on and leads to a list of all the contents related to the selected entry. 
- A search with occurrence can also be made to explore the projects, notions and articles.

As a conclusion, the platform is made to enable the users to shuffle the data to navigate through the information following their own path.

#### Participate

For now, we are feeding the platform with a selection of projects, articles, notions and ressources of our own curation and with the proposals of a narrow circle of artists, designers and academics from our network.

However, *ourcollaborative.tools* has been thought as a participative archive and will soon be opened to proposals. More symbolically, its role is also to engage a community of creators motivated by the idea of ​​creative collaboration.

In that aim, we first need to decide on how we want to moderate to maintain editorial coherence. We are currently thinking about writing participation guidelines and setting up a form to submit contents we would have to validate before publishing.

### What will come next?

From the begining, ourcollaborative.tools as been thought to be a pedagogical tool we could use in our schools, so the first thing to come next will be testing it with students.

We first intent to use it for research work, by exploiting its potential as a participative archive with contents to explore as well as to nourrish. 

It is also a constantly evolving tool we would like to improve with their involvment with both technical and editorial perspectives.

Then, as a data-base and thanks to interoperability, we could imagine giving it many different forms (web-to-print publciations, exhibitions, etc.). We would like to explore these possibilities with students, through collaborative curatorial, editorial and design projects.

It is very important to us that his platform doesn't become a static archive but remains a material that can be shaped, in constant process. To this end, *ourcollaborative.tools* will pass form hand to hand, grow, mutate and be forked through classes and workshops.
