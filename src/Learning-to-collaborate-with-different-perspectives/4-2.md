## Cooperative games made by students

Throughout the week, students organized themselves into inter-school
teams to develop game concepts. We ended the week with a day of public
opening and testing of the game prototypes. Students had the occasion to
get immediate feedback from various types of public including children.
It was also a great exercise for them to present their work to an
audience also composed of people out of the art and design field.

#### Game concept

The concept of the game is that all participants have to reach the
center or the number 0. In order to move forward and reach your goal,
there are challenges that need to be achieved. The challenges have
certain restrictions. If successful, you get closer to the center.
Except you\'re not the one doing the challenges. It\'s everyone
participating in the game that are doing the challenge for you. And you
moving closer to the center depends on how well they succeed in the
given challenge.

#### Your success depends on their success.

Think of it this way: Life throws you challenges, and many restrictions
come along. Many of them require your motivation but also the help of
others. Sometimes you succeed and sometimes you don\'t. But you keep on
trying. And that\'s life.

A small story for this game: *\"You thought you were just going to play
cards with your friends. But a strange murmur is charming you from the
center of the decks. You want to know more. You\'re curious. You try to
get closer, but a thin wall is stopping you reaching that voice. Walls
in the form of circles. You cannot go through alone. One challenge is
given to have the chance of hearing this charm of a voice and finding
the answer to your curiosity. That requires help. Bribes are in the way;
the cards reveal a way for you to move closer and closer. But beware,
those challenges hide glitches. You\'re bounded to the others. You
cannot move with the others. Follow the voice, unite and find that
murmur you\'re looking for.\"*

#### Rules and restrictions of the game

The game is played by a minimum of five people.

-   Each player will have a ticket that indicates their position.
-   All players will begin at the same circle (depending on the number
    of players and rounds you\'d like to play) but the minimum is 3.
-   The youngest player gets the first call.
-   You have two decks of cards, one deck that is the challenge given
    called \"challenge\" and the other that is restriction given for the
    challenge the player will do which is called \"glitch\".
-   Shuffle each deck at every turn, then draw a card from each deck.
    You have to say what\'s the challenge and what\'s the restriction,
    but you cannot participate in it.
-   Everyone on the same circle as the player calling the challenge, can
    choose to participate by raising their hand and getting around the
    caller.
-   With each call, one should be devoted (a minimum of one player) and
    one should step aside. When the caller reveals the combination, a
    given time is set and the responders will have to coordinate to
    achieve the challenge together, as a scene.
-   It\'s up to the player aside to decide if the challenge has been a
    success or not by raising their hand.
-   If it\'s a success, the caller of the challenge moves to the next
    circle and chooses the next caller from the ones that have responded
    to their call.
-   It the challenge was not a success; the next caller is chosen within
    the players that are aside.

When two people are alone in the same circle, they should go along with
the same combination:

- In this case, each of them picks on other player, and the teams
present their \"answer\" at the same time.
- The selected player goes on and chooses the next caller// or if it
leaves a player behind the group (on the lower circle), everyone should
join forces (even the caller) and \"answer\" the challenge for one to
pass.
- The player keeps the call.

#### What was the process during the game design?

We started with the goal of creating a game that embodied the concept of
"competitive by cooperation". This guiding principle helped us during
the brainstorming and ideation process. We began by mentioning different
game ideas that could fit into this category, such as Mario Party, Fall
Guys, and Simon Says. We then proceeded to describe these games and
identify common elements, such as the equal opportunities and fairness
given to all players. It was a collection of bits and pieces from
various games that we remembered, all falling under the theme of
"competitive by cooperation".

#### Iteration and Testing

For the iteration process, we relied on questioning every step and rule
we implemented. As we progressed in laying down the possible platform,
we constantly tore apart each idea by asking \'what if.\' This approach
allowed us to strip away unnecessary steps, rules, and gaps that the
game might not need, ensuring that all players would remain engaged,
progress, and enjoy the story.

Due to time constraints, we were unable to physically test the game
extensively, as it requires a full immersion with a significant number
of people for a time period exceeding 5 or 10 minutes. However, we
conducted testing in two parts. Firstly, we showed our printed cards to
various individuals and observed their curiosity and excitement as they
imagined themselves undertaking the challenges and restrictions.
Secondly, during the exhibition day, we witnessed the actual immersive
experience of the game.

### Spacimen

##### Sarah Hadjazi, Felix HÃ¤berle, Yareny Duriez

#### Game concept

Spacimen is a game about survival, which is why it combines elements of
collaboration and competition. Up to four participants are given a
limited amount of time to create and shape a Spacimen (creature)
according to a set of predetermined parameters derived from a specific
natural environment. These parameters are presented in the form of
statements and a story, allowing players to imagine and interpret the
world in their own unique way

{% image "img_8634.jpg", "The board game during the last day for testing", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw" %}
<figcaption>The board game during the last day for testing </figcaption>

#### Rules of the game

-   Shuffle the circular pieces of the Worlds and stack them face down.
-   Group the 4 Facts & Scene cards according to the environments they
    represent and place them within reach of all players.
-   Distribute an equal moment of clay to each player.
-   The round begins when one of the Worlds pieces is placed in the
    center of the board.
-   When the World is revealed, all players must take the corresponding
    card, read the Facts & Scene and keep it visible.
-   Within 2 minutes, each player must build a Spacimen that can survive
    in the given World, following the Facts & Scene.
-   Each player must defend how & why their Spacimen is the ideal
    inhabitant for the given World.
-   Players must take notes, question, and assess every Spacimen's
    features based on their viability in the World's described in the
    Facts & Scene.
-   1 point is awarded for the best feature for each fact of the World.
-   After defending their Spacimens and reviewing all the Facts have
    been revised, players must calculate their earned points.
-   The player with the most points wins the round and the World. The
    player with no points loses the round and can't play in the next
    round.
-   The round for the next World may begin.

Semi Final & Final Trial:

-   When only one World remains, all Spacimens must collaborate.
-   Before the assessment of the second-to-last World, all Spacimens
    must find a partner for the final round.
-   The assessment proceeds as usual, but for the start of the final
    round, they must work in pairs. One person models, and the other
    person directs.
-   The player with more points in this round wins. In case of a tie,
    the player with more Worlds wins overall.

#### Restrictions of the game

-   Players have 2 minutes to shape their Spacimen according to the
    given environment
-    Each fact represents a specific number of points, which determine
    the winner of the round.
-    The players must collectively decide who earns the points for each
    environment and discuss the reasons behind their decisions.

-   Research
-   Analysis of the potential approach
-   Exploration
-   Ideation
-   Definition of the product

#### Iteration

The discussion of the rules was an ongoing process. We did a draft of
the assumed rules, but definitely we had to try it out among ourselves
and with others to actually understand the needed logic for the game to
make sense and create a playful, yet collaborative & competitive
environment as we have established our wish.

<figcaption>Iteration for research purpose</figcaption>


#### Testing

Before printing or cutting the pieces of the game, we tested the game
with the illustrations of the environments for testing the needed time
for shaping the creatures, to test with external audience if the
illustration made sense with the narrative facts and to also measure how
fun would the challenge and assessing the results be!

#### End Result

The final result demonstrated to be very fun for the audience. We saw
smiles, laughs, debating, stress and engagement while playing, which
successfully portrays the kind of game we wanted to design, searching
for surprises that stimulate imagination but also provide perspective
and stretch the standard way of thinking of the participants. We wanted
for this game to also foster communication between the participants, in
a debate form for taking decisions, as we believe that this would be a
very good example of how collaboration and competition can exist in the
same world.

#### Progress

We are currently discussing how to improve the rules and the logical
acquisition of points, aiming to create fewer controversies and make the
decisions less subjective. We want to better align the point system with
the elements of the game and the stories depicted in each world.

<figcaption>Aela game elements </figcaption>

#### Game concept

Aela is a drawing game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and
encourages creativity. It is designed to be easy to understand and play,
without a specific goal but focused on having fun. If you feel you have
played enough, you should be able to stop playing at any time.

#### Rules of the game

-   You need at least three people to play the game. Two people form a
    team, and the others guess.
-   The team picks a keyword and both team members roll the dice. The
    displayed restriction is the rule they have to follow while drawing
    the keyword.
-   Now, the team has 30 seconds to collaborate and create a drawing
    that represents the chosen keyword, using only drawings without
    talking.
-   Once the 30 seconds are over, the other players have to guess the
    keyword based on both drawings.
-   To continue game, form new teams and start the next round.
-   Play for as long as you have fun. There's no winner or loser!

{% image "symbols.jpg", "the rules of the game", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw" %}
<figcaption>the rules of the game</figcaption>

#### Restrictions of the game

Each player is given a restriction in drawing by the dice.

They are also given a 30-second time limit for drawing and a restriction
not to speak while drawing.

#### What was the process during the game design

We started with just brainstorming around keywords like simple, body,
random, collaborative. Afterwards we tried to connect different words
and categories to combine them and formulate possible games out of it.
Then we came up with different contexts like where should it be played
and who should play it etc.

#### Iteration and testing

First, we came up with the idea of combining the whispering game with
drawing. We also made a paper dice to give players constraints such as
\"draw without looking\". When we tested it, we found that the
constraint idea worked but it\'s too easy to play and the waiting time
was boring. Next, based on the feedback in the first test, we changed
our concept that two people working together to complete one picture
instead of one person drawing each. We also increased the variety of
constraints. In the second test, we saw participants enjoyed it much
more than before. Finally, we made wood dices with 8 faces, 40 cards
with keywords, and instruction paper. We selected keywords that are
conceptual and can be interpreted differently by different people such
as \"sustainable\".

### Collanque: a collaborative petanque

##### Morgane Rousseau, Helen Staak, Florens Schwendowius

#### Game concept

The concept of the game is that a group of people have to throw a ball
collaboratively. They have to communicate well to coordinate their
movement, so that the ball flies in the right direction.

#### Rules of the game

The game is played between two to four teams, each consisting of two to
four players. Each team uses three balls. To start, place the tiny pink
ball (called cochonnet) on the ground and distribute the different
shapes around it, ensuring an equal distance of one large step between
each shape.

Build teams and choose a color. Then, grab the fabric and balls of your
team\'s chosen color. Position yourselves five large steps away from the
cochonnet. In a team of four, each member gets a leash to grab. If there
are only two players in the team, each team member gets two leashes to
grab. Place a ball on top of the fabric. In a team of three, fold the
opposite corners of the fabric to create a triangle.

The aim is to get as close as possible to the cochonnet. Repeat this
step with the second and third ball. Once all the balls have been
thrown, measure which ball is closest to the cochonnet. The team that
has thrown this ball receives three points, while the team whose ball is
furthest away receives a deduction of one point.

After counting the points, collect the balls and start a new round. The
team that reaches nine points first is declared the winning team.

**SHAPES** When a thrown ball lands on a shape the team has to do an
extra difficulty in the next throw: - Stand on one leg during the next
throw. - Close your eyes during the next throw. - You're not allowed to
speak during the next throw. - Throw from five steps further away during
the next throw.

#### Restrictions of the game

Minimum two people in a team, maximum four. Minimum two teams, maximum
four. For the best experience, it is recommended to be played outdoors,
on grass, gravel or flat terrain, where the balls do not roll away or
bounce too much.

#### What was the process during the game design

After going through a lot of ideas we landed on a concept, which we gave
a working name \"collaborative petanque\". The initial inspiration came
from two already existing games: petanque and parachute. As petanque is
a very popular game around France, which we also saw played a lot around
the school grounds, we wanted to take this already familiar concept and
find ways to make it more collaborative.

<figcaption>Iteration with a first prototype</figcaption>

#### Iteration

Our first idea was to use the regular petanque boules and some kind of
fabric that would be used to throw the boules. We tested the first idea
of the game outside on the school grounds by using a stone and a jacket.
When we saw that it could work, we started searching for materials to
create our first prototype. We were able to use the leftover fabric from
the Design Biennale and created our first version of the game. When the
fabric was done, we tested it with different paper balls and then bought
different sized balls from the store to see how they work with the game.
We also moved away from the original formation of the petanque game,
where people play the game one after each other in a line. We thought it
might be much more emotional, when the teams are placed in a circle
facing each other. After that we tested the game with two teams and
different kinds of balls outside on grass. Everything seemed to work
well, but we felt that the game was still missing something. We got a
recommendation from our mentors that we could add some additional
features to make the game more challenging. We decided to create shapes
out of cardboard that could be put on the ground while playing and would
challenge the players more. We also decided to add leashes to the fabric
so it would be more comfortable to hold them. The final version of the
shapes for the game were laser cut from plywood and we also decided to
engrave the challenges on them, so they would always be visually there
and easy to keep in mind while playing.

<figcaption>Cutting the shapes</figcaption>

#### Testing

The testing was a crucial part in our design process. Right from the
start we tested our ideas and developed them further with the
experiences we made. While testing the game the participants had very
interesting ideas for variations of the game that differed from the
original idea.

Therefore, the game could additionally be used in other ways as well:

-   Using the fabrics to throw and catch a ball in two teams of two to
    four people
-   Using the circle shape in the middle to throw the ball through it
    and catch it with the fabric
-   Using the circle in the middle on the ground and make the ball
    bounce in the middle of the circle

#### End Result

The end result is the game called \'Collanque.\' The name is a
combination of \'petanque,\' the word for a French boules sport in which
players play their balls towards a target ball. The game consists of one
small ball to place in the middle, three different sized and weighted
balls for each team to throw, fabrics for teams of two to four people to
throw the balls with, and four different shapes to put on the ground for
extra challenges.

#### Game concept

You play as a designer who is always seeking new technology to improve
their work. In pursuit of this, you purchased a brand new 5D printer
from a dubious website. Excited to test its capabilities, you attempted
to print a file, but to your surprise, it caused a rift, splitting your
reality in half. Now, you and your friend must work together to merge
the two realities back into one.

#### Rules of the game

Your room, which used to be purple, has been affected by the split in
reality, resulting in two dimensions. As a consequence, your room, along
with some objects within it, has been divided into the red room and the
blue room. One player interacts with the split reality of the red room,
while the other player is in the blue room. The objects in each room
that are colored opposite to their surroundings hold the keys to
restoring and fixing the merged reality.

When the objects affected by the split reality are placed into the 5D
printer, they reveal riddles that provide codes for teleporting the
objects to their respective realities. Some of the riddles require
collaboration with your friend, as crucial hints are hidden in their
room. The ultimate goal is to solve all the riddles and successfully
merge the realities, allowing you to return to your original purple
room.

#### Restrictions of the game

Communication with your friend is not possible within the game itself.
As the game is designed to be played in different physical locations,
you must find alternative ways to communicate, such as through phone
calls or text messages, to emulate the experience of being in different
realities. The game can be played offline, as it consists of two mystery
games intended to be played simultaneously, with each game containing
hints that are relevant to the other player\'s game.

#### What was the process during the game design?

Initially, we contemplated creating a detective or mystery game. While
the basic idea was present from the start, the plot required some
adjustments as it would serve as the central element of the game. We
began by discussing the story of a physics professor whose science
experiment went awry, resulting in the splitting of his reality into two
separate dimensions.

#### Testing

We created and developed various riddles, and then approached different
people to solve them. The solving time varied, with some riddles proving
more challenging while others were relatively straightforward. The
difficulty often depended on the individual\'s experience and
familiarity with the subject matter. Knowledge of pop culture references
proved helpful during the solving process. Considering our target
audience, we wanted to appeal to individuals who grew up with these pop
culture moments and could share them with people from other generations.
To ensure accessibility for everyone, we decided to include hints within
the game.

### The Cube

##### MaÃ«lys Bard, AlfÃ©a Morelli, Mark Uustalu

#### Game concept

The Cube is a cooperative game designed for two players, combining
elements of interactive storytelling and escape games. The game revolves
around a story where one friend finds themselves trapped in a bar with
no recollection of their whereabouts due to excessive drinking. They
reach out to another friend for help and rescue. The objective is to
successfully save the trapped friend, leading to a happy ending.

In the game, one player assumes the role of the trapped friend inside
the bar. They navigate the bar through a series of images that they can
switch between, exploring their surroundings to gather information that
they must then relay to their friend. The other player engages with the
game on a computer, presented with choices and riddles that they must
communicate with their partner to answer correctly.

#### Rules of the game

You have to communicate with your partner in order to win. Spamming
through answers is not allowed. You need to actually try to complete the
riddles. You are not allowed to see what the other person sees.

#### Restrictions of the game

You can\'t inspect scenes in more detail.

#### What was the process during the game design

Firstly, we decided to create a video game. Then we came up with the
idea of making it a storytelling game with choices and cooperative
gameplay. We proceeded to sketch out the game\'s path and assigned tasks
to each team member. The process went smoothly, and everyone actively
contributed. While we all worked on the story, special thanks go to
MaÃ«lys for contributing most of the good ideas. MaÃ«lys and AlfÃ©a created
the 3D models and scenes using Blender, while Mark developed and coded
the playable part of the game in Twine.

#### Iteration

The core loop of the game is to solve the riddles/answer the questions,
communicate you're your teammate to make correct choices, win/die.

#### Testing

The gameplay was fully tested with a handful of different people, and we
also discussed the idea with teachers and other individuals. Overall,
everyone liked it.

#### End Result

End result came out like we imagined. We wanted to make a game that
isn\'t just a basic prototype, but something truly playable.

#### Inspiration

Our inspiration was the *trax* game. We liked the simplicity, the shapes
and the intuitive way the game was designed. However, we wanted to
design a game for more than two players, so we needed to bring the game
to a higher complexity.

#### Ideas

So next up, we played with geometrical shapes and built different
symbols, creating a puzzle that could be assembled into different
symbols depending on the focus color. We prototyped this game on paper
and were pleased with the results. However, we soon realized that it was
a non-cooperative, single-player game. Therefore, while keeping the
concept of different colored lines on each square, we decided to go back
to the idea of tracks, incorporating a starting and an ending point.

#### Conception

To make the game more collaborative, we made the decision for each
player to choose one color. Using the same concept of lines on the
square cards, the goal is for players to connect the starting and ending
points of their chosen color. During this phase, we were introduced to
the game "*Connect*" by Ken Garland, which captivated us with its
geometric and simple appearance. Additionally, we discovered the synonym
of *train* or *metro* tracks, which further resonated with our game
concept.

#### Paper prototype

We decided to create small squares with the various geometric shapes
needed for our game in our initial **paper prototype**. During this
stage, we discovered that there are numerous possible variations, which
led us to the realization that we needed to determine the specific
versions and quantity of cards required for a playable and enjoyable
game.

{% image "untitled_presentation-4.jpg", "We test a paper prototype", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw" %}
<figcaption>We test a paper prototype</figcaption>

After creating the squares for the paper prototype, we gathered to play
a round and refine the game\'s details. We soon realized the need to
limit the number of colors on each tile and enforce the rule of having
only one line exiting from each side. Without these restrictions, it
would become excessively challenging to find matching pieces for the
players to connect. As a result, we ended up with eleven distinct
pieces, each with its own color variations

#### Materials

In the subsequent stages, we conducted tests using different materials
for our pieces. We were particularly drawn to the concept of using clear
plexiglass with colorful lines. To implement this, we created a testing
document in Illustrator and used a laser cutter to engrave the lines
onto the plexiglass. We then hand-colored the lines using Posca markers.
The aesthetic result was pleasing, but we soon realized it lacked
practicality in terms of usability. The one-sided pieces could be
accidentally turned around, rendering the intended line restrictions
ineffective. Our second version, which involved combining two pieces
back-to-back, also proved confusing as it created the impression that
all lines needed to be connected, which was not the case. Additionally,
the painted lines were prone to scratching, making them less durable for
repeated use.

Our second test involved using pressed wood. We drew the lines on it
using the AxiDraw and then cut it with the laser cutter. This material
proved to be much better for the game, so we decided to use it for our
final prototype.


#### Final game

Our game is called \'Metro,\' and the goal is to complete the metro line
and conclude your travels. It is designed for up to four players, with
each player needing to complete their colored lines. Our final prototype
consisted of 72 unique pieces and included the game instructions.

#### Rules

Game for two to four players.

Before the game:

-   Each player chooses one color (orange, red, blue or green). The
    pieces with end and start points are part of the stack and must be
    found by drawing a new piece each turn.
-   Each player gets three pieces, the remaining pieces are stacked on
    the side.
-   The player whose birthday is next starts the game.

During the game:

-   The player begins by drawing a piece from the stack **or** from the
    already constructed metro plan (not possible for the very first
    move)
-   One of the four pieces **must** **now** **be added to the metro
    plan**.
-   Pieces can only be added if the lines fit with all the surrounding
    pieces.
-   Pieces must be placed in a way that each \"empty\" space has no more
    than two different colors ending it.

#### Congratulations!

The player who has both their starting and ending point of the metro
line connected first, wins.


## Conclusion and openings

During the first workshop in Tallinn, we had the feeling of passing an
important step, this was also the case here.

The notions of collaboration, cooperation and participation appeared
more complex than we had anticipated: it was the major topic of the week
and students were invited to participate to the reflection on those
notions.

The theme of games fulfilled its purpose to serve as a common cultural
basis, with students tracking the tiny national differences of some of
them and sharing games they like. It also allowed students to design
games with the technical knowledge and tools at their disposal
respectively within their team and within Esadse. Everyone was then in a
kind of \"comfort area\" since no methods or tools were imposed.

The process of the game design also allowed us to step aside and move
away, for a moment, from the digital and functional perspectives that we
are used to.

Finally, we had the feeling that student had a great time and got the
chance to know better each other's, mostly by working together in
international teams. Their differences in methods were less visible than
in the previous workshop and were mostly perceived as an added value.
