## Radical collaboration : HfG's workshop, 21-25 November 2022, Schwäbisch Gmünd (GE)

New workshop, new rules.

At HfG Schwäbisch Gmünd, Marc Guntow, Ludwig Kannicht, and Florian
Geiselhart introduced a new working format in the form of three
simultaneous workshops, each focusing on specific organizations and
subjects. These workshops were conducted during the International
Workshops Week at HfG, providing a valuable opportunity to share the
outcomes with a large audience during the final presentation at the end
of the week. The entire school transformed into a museum, with workshop
exhibitions displayed in various rooms.

#### Lets Kill zoom calls

Florian revisited the subject we had previously discussed, which
involved taking a critical approach to reinventing communication
software such as Zoom. We will delve further into this workshop in the
following chapter.

#### Collaborative interaction patterns

Marc suggested exploring the history of the mouse pointer and examining
potential contemporary advancements. We will provide further explanation
about this workshop in a later section.

#### Radical collaboration

At Ludwig\'s suggestion, we embarked on a reflection about the dynamics
of collaboration in our workplaces and school teams. We explored the key
conditions for effective teamwork, strategies for resolving challenging
collaboration situations, and appropriate behaviors towards our
teammates. We also considered whether it is advisable to openly share
our personal feelings within a professional context. Throughout the
project, we maintained a project logbook on our wiki, which is
reproduced below.

"Why are you here?" They collectively shared their motivations using the
popcorn method:

-   Exploring the meaning of collaboration and understanding if it
    differs for each individual.
-   Meeting new people and reconnecting with the students they had met
    in previous DTCC workshops.
-   Taking a break from their job and being a full-time student.
-   Learning the fundamentals of working together after experiencing
    challenges or failures in previous team projects.
-   Overcoming frustration in teamwork, stop being a people pleaser and
    finding their place within a team.
-   Finding their strengths and valuing them in teamwork.
-   Breaking away from the usual teams, embracing different work habits
    and methods.

    based on teammates' skills and strengths.
-   Creating a cohesive team that goes beyond a mere combination of
    individual projects.

After that, students discussed their experiences with teamwork within
small groups, then shared them with the whole group.

Ludwig has shown a video by Marianne Simmel and Fritz Heider (1944) and
asked students to reflect on what they observed first individually and
then, back in groups.

#### P.M.

The afternoon started with some teambuilding exercices.

Then, the group discussed what they could present for the exhibition on
Friday to empower fellow designers for teamwork. Ludwig asked them to
also think of future teammates who hadn\'t been there. They formed two
discussion circles.

At the end of the day, they presented their discussions using the
fishbowl method. They arranged a circle of listeners around a smaller
circle for speakers. People in the center had a discussion while those
on the outer circle listened. If someone from the outer circle wanted to
speak, they could join the center circle. If there was no more space in
the center, the person who had been speaking the longest would give up
their seat. The goal of this exercise was to reach agreement on ideas
and create a cohesive plan for the exhibition on Friday.

For now, they have agreed to create performances, documentation (to
capture what happened), and a printed takeaway publication (such as a
poster, booklet, or cards?)

<figcaption>Feedback from students to improve the next days</figcaption>

As a conclusion, throughout the day, they experienced working in small
teams (3-4 members), medium teams (2 groups), and as a large team (all
together). They concluded the journey by collectively reflecting on
their own feelings about working in these teams during the day.
Additionally, Ludwig asked for feedback from the students, seeking their
input on what he should keep, what he should drop, and what he should
change to improve his preparation for the next days.

### Day 2

#### A.M.

We started the workshop a bit later this morning due to beginning the
day with a guided tour of the school led by Marc. At 10:30, Ludwig
announced the schedule for the week and provided students with a
template example of an email for soliciting feedback. In fact,
yesterday, students suggested requesting 10 to 15 minutes of feedback on
their proposals from three to six different people.

Then, it was time for the initial team building. Ludwig prompted the
students to reflect and engage in a collective discussion about their
\'origin systems\': what values or aspects do they hold dear and would
like to see in their new group? What would they prefer to leave behind?
Additionally, Ludwig encouraged them to envision elements they never
experienced before but would like to initiate. He also requested that
they find metaphors to represent their "origin systems".

At the end of the morning, the students began working on how they wanted
to organize themselves as a team for the exhibition. Using the fish
bubble method, they aimed to collectively decide on defining sub-teams
to divide tasks.

Initially, they came up with the idea of creating three teams, each
responsible for a specific aspect:

-   Performance
-   Traces
-   Take-away

However, they soon realized the need to establish connections between
these teams to ensure that all parts merged together as a cohesive
project. This sparked a lively debate on the necessary adjacent roles to
maintain coherence throughout the separated components of the exhibition
project. Additionally, there was a discussion on how to precisely define
the teams.

#### P.M.

The debate initiated in the morning continued at the beginning of the
afternoon. They decided to make flexible teams for now.

{% image "IMG_5155.JPG", "Debate about three forms of power", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw" %}
<figcaption>Debate about three forms of power</figcaption>

Ludwig then initiated a talk about three forms of power: - power of
sovereignty: the given power through hierarchy (top-down, sometimes
bottom-up through vote). - power of sense-making: the power given by
other members of the team because what someone is saying is making sense
to others (bottom-up). This power is mostly relying on charisma. - power
of the creator: this power relies on people thinking that a person is a
rightful leader, capable of being in charge of a specific project and
push-it forward.

Power is not only a matter of "control". It is important to understand
these different types of power because power is also a means of
influencing a project. Power can help expedite decision-making, but it
should not be used to corrupt. An interesting question raised by a
student was: should people in power be individuals who do not desire to
be leaders to prevent the abuse of power?

After this talk, they made small groups to exchange their experiences of
these forms of power. Ludwig asked them to reflect on their strengths
and weaknesses in being a leader.

{% image "IMG_5163.JPG", "Manage tensions when working in teams", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw" %}
<figcaption>Manage tensions when working in teams</figcaption>

Afterward, Ludwig had a talk about tensions and the need to be able to
manage tensions when working in teams:

-   sense of tensions
-   collect tensions
-   address tensions

He made a link between tensions and non-violent communication and
criticized the term itself. Communication would always be about
information transfer and relationship clarification. A message always
come in both layers and is received in both layers. The relationship
layer always defines the interpretation of the information. Voice, tone,
attitude (non-verbal communication) are sub-messages that impact how the
information is transmitted.

What is a complete communication?

-   Observation: What is causing tension?
-   Feelings: What triggers these feelings in me?
-   Need: What is important to me?
-   Request: What could bring me closer?

During this process of communication, Ludwig insisted on the importance
of following certain rules:

-   Be present (in the situation).
-   Be authentic (express your true feelings).
-   Be empathetic (have a good understanding of your point of view but
    also seek to understand the situation your interlocutor is in).

This slide moment was then followed by a role play.

### Day 3: A special day with introspective work on participants

How did you feel on that day? How did these exercises develop a sense of
group and collaboration? Can you share your experience, if you wish, in
a few lines?

### Day 4

#### A.M.

This morning, the workshop started with a little game to wake everybody
up after last night\'s mulled-wine party at school. Then, Ludwig gave a
presentation about \"How to: critical feedback.\" To explain the value
square concept in a more interactive way, he asked students to:

-   Provide positive feedback to one another.
-   Share a value they see in someone and its counterpart.
-   Devalue someone\'s value (e.g., a flexible person =\> you are
    chaotic) to illustrate overcompensation, which can be a source of
    conflicts.

This lecture was supposed to be followed by an activity where students
could experiment with giving and receiving feedback. However, due to a
lack of time, they held a vote and decided to skip this activity in
order to have more time to work on Friday\'s exhibition. Before
returning to their exhibition teams, they did a quick activity to share
the feedback they received yesterday.

#### P.M.

The afternoon was dedicated to project work, with students divided into
teams working on a poster, a performance, and its script. One of the
students was assigned the role of coordinating between the teams.

### Final presentation

The performance took place three times on the final day, which was
dedicated to the presentation of all the workshops conducted throughout
the week. It was accompanied by a poster that served as a take-away,
containing the key reflections and insights generated by the students
during the workshop

The performance titled "*Why are you here?*" was a participative play
that depicted a conflictual collaboration situation. The audience was
actively engaged throughout the performance and was regularly invited to
make choices on how to react to the unfolding situation. These decisions
directly influenced the course of the collaboration.

The performance drew inspiration from forum theater, a technique
developed by Brazilian theater director Augusto Boal as part of the
Theater of the Oppressed (TO) methodology. However, the students chose
to structure their performance as a multiple-choice experience, where
the possibilities were somewhat constrained, rather than a completely
open-ended play allowing for spontaneous action from the spect-actors.
