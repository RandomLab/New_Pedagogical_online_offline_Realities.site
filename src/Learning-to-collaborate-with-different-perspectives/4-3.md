## Radical collaboration : HfG's workshop, 21-25 November 2022, Schwäbisch Gmünd (GE)

New workshop, new rules. 

At the HfG Schwäbisch Gmünd, Marc Guntow, Ludwig Kannicht and Florian Geiselhart offered us another working format: three simultaneous workshops with specific organizations and subjects.

Those workshops took place during the International Workshops Week in HfG so it was a great opportunity to share the results with a large audience during the final presentation at the end of the week, when the whole school became a museum with workshop exhibitions in many rooms.

#### Lets Kill zoom calls
Florian returned to the subject we had previously discussed, ie with a critical approach, to reinvent communication softwares like Zoom. We will come back on this workshop later. We will come back on this workshop in the following chapter.

#### Collaborative interaction patterns
Marc suggested taking an interest in the history of the mouse pointer and all possible contemporary developments. This workshop will also be explained later on. 

#### Radical collaboration
On a proposal from Ludwig, it was a question of reflecting on the conditions of collaboration in our work places and school teams. What are the conditions for teamwork that works well? How to fix a bad collaboration situation? How to behave with teamates? Should I share how I personnaly feel in a professional context? A project logbook was kept on our wiki and is reproduced below.

#### A.M.

At first, students made three to four people groups to discuss what they expect from the workshop's week.

Then, they collectively shared their motivations with the popcorn method:
- what does collaboration means, is it the same for everybody?
- meet new people and meet again with the students met during previous DTCC workshops.
- be only a student: have a break from job.
- learn the basis of working together after previous team projects failures or difficulties, improving communication skills.
- be less frustrated with teamwork, stop being a people pleasure, find my place in teams.
- find my strengths and value them in teamwork.
- break the usual teams, open-up to people who have different work habits and methods.
- improve human interactions.
- discover the city.
- find out why some previous team projects went only "ok".
- find good bretzels.
- how to manage tensions within a group to better work within a team.
- escape from personal project for a week.
- fresh-up my english skills.
- I would like to work more in teams but I find it difficult.
- party !
- learn how to communicate so no-one is frustrated, how to divide the work regarding skills and strenghts of teammates.
- how to go beyond a mashup of different personal projects to really build a team: the team as a whole should be better that the sum of individuals.
- find a balance between enjoying and working: too much work is actually less efficiency.
- focus on collaboration on itself.
- try some good beers.
- get to know something new on myself.
- I have the stressful habit of wanting to finish fast and push myself so when I'm working within a team, I find myself being constantly the leader managing teamwork. That's a very stressful situation I would like to avoid being in everytime.
- being more comfortable with being in a group.
- have a theoretical background about collaboration.
- within the school, we can choose our teamates and even if we like the people we work with, it's sometimes difficult. I want to be prepared for when I will have to work with people I didn't choose and who may work really differently.

After that, students discussed their experiences with teamwork within small groups, then shared them with the whole group.

Ludwig has shown a video by Marianne Simmel and Fritz Heider (1944) and asked students to reflect on what they observed first individually and then, back in groups.

Then, the group discussed about what they could present for the exhibition on friday to empower fellow designers for teamwork. Ludwig asked them to also think of future team mates who haven't been there. They made two discussion circles.

At the end of the day, they presented what they discussed with the fish bubble method. They displayed a listening circle around a small talking circle. People in the middle have a discussion, people around are listening. If they want to talk, they go into the center circle. If there is no more space in the center, the person who wants to talk takes the seat of the one who as been the longest in the talking spot. The goal of this exercice is to agree on some ideas and make a common plan of what's going to be displayed on friday.

For now, they agreed on making:
- performances
- documentation (traces of what happened)
- a printed take away publication (poster, booklet, cards ?)

<figcaption>Feedback from students to improve the next days</figcaption>

As a conclusion: during the day, they experienced working in small teams (3-4), in medium teams (2 groups) and as a large team (all together). They ended the journey by reflecting collectively on their own feelings of working in these teams during the day. Ludwig also asked some feedback from the students (what should he keep? What should he drop? What should he change?) to improve is preparation for next days.

### Day 2

#### A.M.

We started the workshop quite late this morning because we started the day with the school guided tour led by Marc.

At 10:30, Ludwig announced the schedule of the week and gave students a template example of an email for asking feedbacks. Indeed, yesterday, students proposed to ask 10 to 15mns feedbacks on their proposals to three to six different people.

<figcaption>Prepare the week with a planning</figcaption>

Then, it was time for the initial team building. Ludwig asked students to reflect and discuss together about their "origin systems": what do they value and would like to find again in their new group? What would they like to leave behind? What they never had in their background and would like to initiate? He also asked that they find metaphors for their "origin systems".

At the end of the morning, students started to work on how they want to organize as a team to work on the exhibition. With the fish bubble method, they aimed to decide together on defining sub-teams to divide tasks. 

First, they came up with the idea of making three teams respectively in charge with:
- performance
- traces
- take-away

Therefore, they pointed out that there is a need to link every teams together so every parts merge together as a whole project. It led to a big debate on adjacent roles needed to assure coherence between seperated parts of the exhibition project. There was also a debate on how to define teams.

#### P.M.

The debate intiated in the morning continued at the begining of the afternoon. They decided to make flexible teams for now.

{% image "IMG_5155.JPG", "Debate about three forms of power", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw" %}
<figcaption>Debate about three forms of power</figcaption>

Ludwig then initiated a talk about (the) three forms of power:
- power of sovereignity: the given power through hierarchy (top-down, sometimes bottom-up through vote).
- power of sense-making: the power given by other members of the team because what someone is saying is making sense to others (bottom-up). This power is mostly relying on charisma.
- power of the creator: this power relies on people thinking that a person is a rightful leader, capable of being in charge of a specific project and push-it forward.

Power is not only a matter of "control", it is important to understand these different types of power because power is also a manner of influencing a project. Power can help to fasten decision-making but it should not serve to corrupt. An interesting question pointed by a student was: should people in power be persons who don't want to be leaders so it doesn't lead to abuse of power?

After this talk, they made small groups to exchange their experiences of these forms of power. Ludwig asked them to reflect on their strenghts and weeknesses in being a leader.

<figcaption>Manage tensions when working in teams</figcaption>

Afterward, Ludwig had a talk about tensions and the need to be able to manage tensions chen working in teams:
- sense of tensions
- collect tensions
- adress tensions

He made a link between tensions and non-violent communication and criticized the term itself. Communication would always be about information transfer and relationship clarification. A message always come in both layers and is received in both layers. The relationship layer always define the information one. Voice, tone, attitude (non-verbal communication) are a sub-message that impacts how the information is transmitted.

What is a complete communication?
- Observation: what is my tension?
- Feelings: what triggers this in me?
- Need: what is important to me?
- Request: what could bring me closer?

During this process of communication, Ludwig insisted on rules to respect:
- Be present (in the situation).
- Be authentic (express your true feelings).
- Be empathetic (have a good understanding of your point of view but also seek to understand the situation your interlocutor is in).

This slide moment was then followed by a roleplay.

### Day 3: A special day with introspective work on participants

How did you feel on that day?
How did these exercises develop a sense of group and collaboration?
Can you share your experience, if you wish, in a few lines?

### Day 4

#### A.M.

This morning, the workshop started with a little game to wake everybody up after last night mulled-wine party at school.

Then, Ludwig made a presentation about "How to: critical feedback". To explain the value square concept in a more interactive way, he asked students :
- to adress a positive feedback to one another
- to tell someone a value he/she has and its counterpart
- to devalue someone's value (ex: a flexible person => you are chaotic) to illustrate overcompensation (source of conflicts).

This lecture supposed to be followed by a time dedicated to an activity so the students could experiment giving and receiving feedback. Due to a lack of time, they voted and decided to skip this activity to get more time to work on friday's exhibition.

However, before getting back to their exhibition teams, they did a quick activity to share the feedbacks they received yesterday.


#### P.M.

The afternoon was dedicated to project work. Students were divided in teams working on a poster, a performance and its script. One of students was in charge of the coordination between teams.

### Final presentation

The performance happened three times during the final day which was dedicated to the presentation of each and every workshops of the week. It was accompanied by a poster, as a take-away containing all the major reflections engaged by students during the workshop.

*Why are you here?* was the title of the performance that was a participative play which portrayed a conflictual collaboration situation. The audience was regularly invited to choose a way to react to the situation as it unfolded. Their decisions had a direct impact on the running of the collaboration.

Their performance was inspired by the forum theatre which was created by Brazilian theatre director Augusto Boal and is one of the techniques under the common term of Theatre of the Oppressed (TO). However, the students chose to close the possibilities by proposing a multiple-choice performance rather than a play completely open to the action of the spect-actors.
