## Cooperative Games: Play Together, Esadse's workshop,  11-15 April 2021, Saint-Étienne (FR)

In connection with the objectives of the Digital Tools for Creative
Collaboration project, the workshop aimed to provide an experiential
understanding of the fundamental principles underlying collaborative
work. Recognizing the challenges we faced during the initial workshop at
EKA, where we struggled to reconcile our diverse design visions and
methodologies, we believed that games, as a shared cultural artifact,
would serve as a suitable foundation for our exploration.

### Subject and goals of the workshop

Considering that games (including board games, video games, sports
games, etc.) incorporate mechanisms that involve various forms of
collaboration, we decided to center the workshop around the concept of
collective play. While many games emphasize competition, only a few are
centered on collaboration and cooperation, allowing participants to work
together towards a shared victory instead of playing against each other.

During the workshop, we introduced two guiding principles:

-   Designing games collaboratively in small groups.
-   Developing rules that encourage collaboration as a means to achieve
    success.

Esadse provided resources such as laser cutting, 3D printing, and VR
headsets to support the creation of prototypes that could be played on
the final day.

### Talk: Notions about cooperative games

As an introduction to the workshop, David-Olivier Lartigaud discussed
cooperative games, drawing upon references such as the book \"**Rules of
Play: Game Design Fundamentals**\" by Katie Salen Tekinbaş and Eric
Zimmerman (MIT Press, 2003), as well as other sources mentioned in the
text.

#### Conditions for a game to exist

- Every game exists within a defined framework, encompassing a specific time and space, which communicates to players that they are engaged in a game.
- The magic circle, a concept introduced by Johan Huizinga in his book \"Homo Ludens\" (1938), defines the space in which a game unfolds.
    Unlike informal play, which lacks clear boundaries, games establish
    a formalized structure that explicitly delineates the magic circle.
-   Within the magic circle, the game\'s rules create a special set of
    meanings for the players of a game. These meanings guide the play of
    the game.
-   As a system, a game can be considered to have an open or closed
    relationship to its context. Considered as RULES, a game is closed.
    Considered as PLAY, a game is both open and closed. Considered as
    CULTURE, a game is open.
-   The lusory attitude refers to the state of mind necessary to engage
    in gameplay. It entails a collective acceptance of the rules\'
    constraints, driven by the enjoyment and satisfaction that games
    offer.
-   Rules form the fundamental structure of games, defining the
    parameters and interactions within which players operate.
-   Rules limit player action
-   Rules are explicit and unambiguous
-   Rules are shared by all players
-   Rules are fixed
-   Rules are binding
-   Rules are repeatable

While there are games that challenge and deviate from these
characteristics, these traits represent the general attributes of game
rules when viewed strictly from a formal perspective.

#### Games as systems of conflict

-   How many players can participate in the game?
-   Is the gameplay simultaneous or turn-based?
-   Does the game include a high score list?
-   Do players receive continuous feedback on their relative scores?
-   Does the game provide opportunities for players to compare their
    scores and game statistics?
-   Are there computer-generated opponents and obstacles that players
    collectively face, or do the players compete against each other?
-   Does the game structure allow for direct conflicts between players?
-   Are there resources in the game that players can compete for?
-   Can players use money to continue playing or enhance their gameplay?

Coopetition or co-opetition (sometimes spelled \"coopertition\" or
\"co-opertition\") is a neologism coined to describe cooperative
competition. Coopetition is a portmanteau of cooperation and
competition. Basic principles of co-opetitive structures have been
described in game theory [(source: \"Coopetition,\" in Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coopetition).

### Talk: How to make a collaborative game?

Mathias Hû, an Esadse student, presented his incomplete brand game
project: Run-off. The purpose of the presentation was to highlight the
issues and difficulties involved in creating a collaborative game. Here
are some key points discussed:

-   When designing a game for multiple players, it becomes crucial to
    consider how they interact with each other.
-   The most common approach is through **competitive** gameplay, where
    all players compete against each other to win. This can be seen in
    games like Street Fighter, Risk (territorial conquest), or Mario
    Kart (racing for first place).
-   Alternatively, players can be grouped into different teams,
    introducing cooperative relationships within each team. While
    competition still drives the game, it fosters collaboration.
    Examples include team sports like basketball, multiplayer games like
    Overwatch, or brand games like Time\'s Up.

Finally, if you want to create a game that focuses solely on cooperation
without any competitive aspect between players, you need to provide a
new motivation for players to engage in the game. Competition is often
used because it easily attracts people to play and keeps them engaged.
However, there are alternatives to drive cooperative gameplay. Here is
an initial list of alternatives for the core concept of cooperative
games:

-   The desire to **create** something together can be a sufficient
    motivation. This is evident in certain Minecraft servers or
    construction games like Lego or Kapla (although the latter two may
    be more accurately classified as toys with the potential for
    creating games).
-   In other cases, **exploration** serves as a driving force for player
    engagement. This is observed in narrative, linear, or puzzle games.
    The collective desire to uncover the next step, part of the story,
    or environment motivates players to continue together. Examples
    include games like Broforce or Portal 2 in cooperative mode, as well
    as many role-playing games.
-   **The game itself can serve as the opponent** for a collective team
    of players. In this case, the game presents challenges that the team
    must overcome or achieve the most desirable score.

All of these *motors* can be combined and many games use a combination
of them.

#### Run-off

<figcaption>The prototype of the game *Run-Off* by Mathias Hû</figcaption>

Run-off is an incomplete brand game project that initially aimed to
create a competitive game but with a twist: adopting a non-cooperative
strategy proves to be counterproductive for all players involved. The
game begins with individual players pitted against each other, but as
the game progresses, teams gradually form, and collective strategies are
built. In the game, each player is responsible for managing a floor of
tubes in a tower. Rain falls on the top floor and runs off through each
subsequent floor until it reaches the ground. On the ground, each player
has a vase and must collect as much water as possible. However, without
collective coordination, the water is wasted for everyone.

##### Difficulties and conclusions

The game became too complex and required a high level of spatial
projection, which made it challenging to play. Additionally, certain
rules within the game system were unbalanced, further hindering its
playability. These various aspects ultimately rendered the game
unplayable.

This experience has significantly influenced my approach to game
creation. I believe it is crucial to start with a concept that is not
overly complex and focus on achieving a balanced and playable situation
initially, before adding additional features. Maintaining this balance
is delicate, so it is important to extensively test the game with each
rule change to ensure its preservation.

The use of metaphors or narratives can be highly beneficial when
introducing new rules or features, as they tap into our familiarity with
the concepts they represent. This familiarity makes it easier for
players to understand and apply these elements. In the case of Run-off,
the concept of gravity was utilized, allowing players to grasp the
intricate movement of water without the need for extensive explanation,
given their existing familiarity with the concept.

### Talk: Collective creation(s) based on a contributive model

Samantha Zannoni, a Third Cycle student at Esadse, presented her
collective experiment using Olivier Auber\'s poïétique generator. This
net artwork was originally designed and programmed in 1987 as a form of
free art.

Currently, the artwork has been further developed using Ruby on Rails
and JavaScript, allowing anyone to connect to the webpage. Users have
access to a set number of pixels and can draw simultaneously within
their designated strip. The objective of the artwork is not to determine
winners or losers but rather to collaboratively create something

Samantha also introduced various references of collective creations
based on a contributive model.

### Shared references: Video games

In some MMORPGs, such as those with Guild systems, players must join
forces and work together to conquer dungeons or defeat powerful enemies,
drawing inspiration from tabletop RPGs. Participants engage in
discussions, solve puzzles, and coordinate strategies to overcome
challenges.

Additionally, many sandbox games offer cooperative or collaborative
modes. For example, in GTA, players can team up to carry out bank
heists, while Minecraft allows players to collaborate on building
projects. However, the gameplay of these games is not exclusively
focused on cooperation, as players can also pursue individual
activities.

On the other hand, there are games specifically designed to require
cooperation in order to complete or win.

Below are a few examples along with brief comments showcasing the
significance of collaboration in these games:

#### It Takes Two / A way out

Two players must cooperate to complete tasks. It is the complementarity
and coordination of actions that counts.

#### Overcooked

Working together to go fast. What is interesting is that everyone
redistributes tasks according to the situation in order to be as
efficient as possible.

#### Nvidia omniverse

Not a game but proceeds on the same principle. Everyone collaborates on
a specific task to obtain a quick result.

#### Among Us

In this game, there\'re tasks to be done with a common goal (just a
pretext), but the real goal is to find an imposter. Here\'s an
interesting disruptive element, like a bad collaborator. No
synchronization or coordination between actions necessarily. Everyone
does their own thing until it is time to discuss for eliminating a
player. It\'s a bit like some TV shows where several people in a loft
vote to eliminate a roommate. (In the case of Among US, which is
map-based, it is easy to imagine an adaptation in the form of a board or
a card game.)

#### Out of Space

It\'s a collocation game. You have to maintain a *space station*, avoid
dirt, have food, etc.

#### Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes

Collaboration when the players are not at the same level of information.

#### Alternate Reality Games (ARG)

ARG has the power to create communities searching together to solve a
riddle. The cooperation is active after the start of the game and not
before, as in many games. In this case, we can speak more about
contribution, which is a very specific type of cooperation.

#### Heave-Ho

This game is just a lot of fun! It also involves the exploration of a
collective movement created by the addition of individual movements.

#### A Way Out

A videogame created to be played in coop mode only.

#### Brothers : A Tale of Two Sons

This game offers you the possibility to control two characters with a
single controller. Although it is intended to be played by only one
person, it can easily be played by two. This creates a new relationship
with the controller as an individual object and introduces a new way to
play collectively.

#### Medieval games

This game for four players is released on Wii. It simulates a brand game
where each player competes against the others. In each round, all
players participate in a mini-game, and the winner(s) receive rewards
within the overall brand game. The mini-games create various collective
structures, including 1v1v1v1, 2v2, 1v3, and 1v1 with two players who
can assist or hinder one another. These dynamics create alliances and
implicit teams among the players.

### Shared references : Board games

#### Mafia/The Werewolves of Millers Hollow

Two sides engage in a collaborative competition where they silently
exchange information to strategize against each other.

#### 5-Minute Dungeon

A very simple cooperative game!

#### Legend of Andor

A very complicated cooperative game!

#### The Mind

It\'s a very simple board game where players must collaborate on a task
without the ability to communicate verbally. It presents an interesting
challenge of how to achieve a goal with a significant constraint.

#### Mansion of madness - 2nd edition

The game master is a tablet that provides instructions for solving
puzzles together and battling enemies.\"

#### Cerberus

In this brand game, all players start as survivors who must escape from
the cerberus. Cooperation is essential for this objective. However, as
everyone has the potential to be saved, players must sacrifice one
another as each individual who joins the cerberus\'s team becomes an
obstacle in their path.

#### Puzzles

It will be interesting to understand how puzzles, with their
ultra-simple principles, can create collective relations and lead to the
formation of monuments

#### Concept

This game is a \'describe and guess\' game where players have to
describe a concept using a combination of pictograms representing simple
concepts. The interesting aspect of this game is that while it was
originally created with competitive features, they can feel unnatural
and players often choose to abandon them and play in cooperative mode
for the sake of fun.
