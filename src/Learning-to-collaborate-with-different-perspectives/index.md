# Learning to collaborate with different perspectives

Collaboration is rarely a seamless and effortless process; rather, it
requires negotiation and a willingness to learn and work together.
Establishing a productive group dynamic and finding common ground that
extends beyond mere consensus often demands patience, empathy, effective
communication, and open-mindedness. Indeed, collaborating with
individuals who hold diverse perspectives can present significant
challenges. People from different disciplines, cultures, or backgrounds
often bring contrasting approaches, values, and ways of thinking and
working to the table. While these differences are valuable for
generating new ideas and undertaking ambitious projects, they can also
give rise to misunderstandings, conflicts, and communication barriers
within a team.

During [the first workshop in EKA](/methodologies-and-tools-for-collaboration/2-1/), our collaboration was definitely not
easy since we had very different working methods and expectations. As
Ludwig Kannicht aptly remarked after this workshop:

> "The first workshop was an incredibly valuable experience, despite
the challenges we faced. It was a learning journey, even if we had to
overcome some difficulties along the way. Looking back, I realize that
we had diverse cultures and understandings of design. If given the
opportunity to repeat the workshop, I would prioritize addressing these
differences from the start. Allocating dedicated time for open
discussions and understanding each other\'s perspectives would be
crucial. It takes time to bridge the gap when collaborating with
individuals from different contexts. Expecting seamless collaboration
from day one is unrealistic.\"

After the initial workshop, we proceeded to [the second one held in
Esadse](/Learning-to-collaborate-with-different-perspectives/4-1/), Saint-Ã‰tienne in April 2021. For this workshop, we opted for a
more flexible approach, where no specific methods or tools were imposed
or even suggested. The aim was to provide students with the freedom to
experiment and discover their own ways of collaborating, culminating in
the creation of a playable game by the end of the week. The students
were tasked with familiarizing themselves with one another and
leveraging their individual perspectives and skills within small group
settings. Additionally, this week-long workshop provided an excellent
opportunity to explore the nuances between collaboration, cooperation,
contribution, and participation within diverse group dynamics.

During the final DTCC workshop week at HfG, Ludwig led a workshop titled
[Radical Collaboration](/Learning-to-collaborate-with-different-perspectives/4-3/), which specifically focused on collaboration
dynamics from a psychological perspective. In this workshop, he
encouraged the students examine and analyze some collaborative moments
where they encountered obstacles that led to tensions, in order to
better understand what happened and learn how to effectively respond and
navigate similar challenges in the future.

In this chapter, we will revisit these two workshops, recognizing them
as key moments in our collective journey of learning how to collaborate
effectively.

We will then feature interviews with students who participated in these
workshops, offering valuable insights into their experiences and the
lessons they learned within the collaborative context of three European
schools. These workshops not only exposed them to alternative approaches
to design but also introduced them to different school cultures,
methods, and tools that diverged from their usual practices.
Furthermore, the workshops prompted a profound self-reflection,
encouraging students to question their own practices and attitudes in
relation to those of their peers.
