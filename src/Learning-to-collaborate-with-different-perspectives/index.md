# Learning to collaborate with different perspectives

Collaboration is rarely something that comes naturally fluid but is rather a process of negociation and learning to work together. To be able to find a productive group dynamic and a common ground that is not a soft consensus might require a lot of patience, empathy, communication and open-mindness. Indeed, collaborating with individuals who possess different perspectives can present significant challenges. People from distinct disciplines, cultures, or backgrounds often bring contrasting approaches, values, and ways of thinking and working to the table. These differences, while valuable for generating new ideas and implement ambitious projects, can also lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and communication barriers within a team.

During the first workshop in EKA, our collaboration was definitely not easy since we had very different working methods and expectations. As Ludwig Kannicht said after this workshop: 
>"It was a super valuable experience. It was perhaps harder than it should have been. But I learned the most at the first workshop, even if you had to go through a valley of tears once. If we could do it again I probably would... We realised along the way that we have very different cultures and understandings of design. If I could do it again, I would simply make it a topic in the first workshop and explicitly allocate time for it, instead of actually pursuing a different goal and then counteracting it. It takes time when you come from different understandings, to put that on the table and
discuss and understand and value where people are
coming from. I think it's just unrealistic that you can come from completely different contexts and work together on day one."

After this first workshop, came the second one in Esadse, Saint-Ã‰tienne in April 2021. We decided to propose a more flexible workshop, with no method or tools imposed or even suggested, so students could experiment their own ways of working together in order to produce a playable game at the end of the week. The students had to get to know each other and make the most of their differences, using each other's perspectives and skills, in a small group setting. This week was also a good opportunity to explore the differences between collaboration, cooperaton, contribution and participation as diverse group work dynamics.

During the final DTCC workshop week in HfG, Ludwig led *Radical Collaboration*, a workshop directly focusing on collaboration dynamics from a psychological perspective. He suggested that the students look at and analyse some collaborative moments when they encountered obstacles that led to tensions, in order to better understand what happened and learn how to better react in such situations.

We will come back on those two workshops in this chapter, as key moments of learning how to collaborate together.

We will then close it with interviews of students who participated in those workshops and who are giving us insights of what they've learned in this context of collaboration within three european schools. Indeed, it opened them up to other ways of doing design, other school cultures, other methods, other tools that they usually use. It was also a time for questioning their practices and postures in relation to the ones of others.
