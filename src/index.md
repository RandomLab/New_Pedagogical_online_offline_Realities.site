At a time when Europe is ending lockdowns, when the vaccination campaign makes us feel optimistic about the future of our lives and professional activity, the Esadse, together with the Estonian Academy of Art, EKA, and the Hochschule für Gestaltung Schwäbisch-Gmünd, its international partners, analyzes the experience of the past year and a half and reflects on how to reinvent art and design education in post-covid times. In response to these questions is born the Digital Tools for Creative Collaboration project co-funded by the Erasmus Programme of the European Commission.

Higher education institutions have been extremely responsive to the conditions imposed by the pandemic crisis. We have managed to organize both teaching and administrative procedures at a distance.  At Esadse, the courses, the reports, the competition have migrated to the digital space. The 2019–2020 activity report stated that “the commitment has been exemplary”. Thus, we have succeeded in continuing, in remaining “open”, but... at what price?  The transition was done in a flash, in the urgency of the situation we used the available digital tools, training ourselves as we went along, often outside of working hours, without carrying out an in-depth reflection on the origin of these softwares, webapps, applications... 

In September 2021, with the return to the “normal”, we started to question ourselves on this experience, without knowing that it was still far from being finished. 

First observation: we could not yet measure the extent of the impact of what had happened. But we shared the feeling that teaching had changed, that we could not go back to the way it was before the crisis — so many challenges lived, so many questions raised. Second observation: the tools that we used, certainly, allowed us to continue the semester, to stay in touch, but were not adapted to the artistic education and the type of interaction it demands. 

It was at this time that we received the exceptional Erasmus + program call for projects addressing the challenges posed by the health crisis and lock down periods . It was organized in two thematic strands:
* “Preparing for digital education”, to strengthen education and training systems to face the challenges presented by the sudden transition to online and distance learning related to the Covid-19 crisis.
* “Partnerships for Creativity” to support the cultural and creative sectors, which have been particularly affected by the health crisis. 

To reply for this call the Random(lab), together with the International Relations team of Esadse (Saint-Étienne, France), decided to build a European project to work for two years on the issue of digital tools for collaboration in art and design.

One doesn’t implement a European project alone. A minimum of three partners from three countries is one of the conditions for participation in the programme. It is also a great opportunity to work with international partners who share our questions about art and design education. For this project, the Esadse Random(lab) decided to turn to the Eesti Kunstiakadeemia - Estonian Academy of Art, University of Design-Hochschule für Gestaltung Schwäbisch-Gmünd and the Bureau of European Design Associations as associated partner.
