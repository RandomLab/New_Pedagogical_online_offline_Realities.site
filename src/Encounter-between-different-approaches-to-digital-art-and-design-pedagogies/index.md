# Encounter between different approaches to digital art and design pedagogies

As we said before, despite the fact that we all evolve in the same disciplinary field we have very different conceptions of design and working methodologies, we also have different pedagogical approaches, as we observed from the first workshop and as students noticed and discussed in their feedbacks.

It was important to us, while thinking about how we would propose a common vision of digital pedagogy, to bring together the following three texts, to let everyone speak, from each school, to better understand our differences which have taken a crucial place in this project as well as to highlight what brings us together.

When we collaborate together in a project whose research object is collaboration, the ways in which we collaborate together become a case study. And our differences of opinion, the tensions they generate, must not be evacuated, they must be used to grasp what is at stake in collaborations that go beyond the self. We regularly noticed that we were looking in different directions and this is perhaps the strength of this project: it looks in opposite directions, which coexist in the design world and rarely have the opportunity to intersect.

In addition to the three actors (Esadse, EKA and HfG) involved in this reflection on the issues at stake when teaching digital art and design practices, we at Esadse, conducted the openschool.art meetings to open the discussion at the scale of France. Indeed, we invited around thirty teachers and students from various french art and design schools to meet in Esadse around those topics on the 10 and 11 of May 2022. Along the way, we have projected in the near future a way to cultivate this dialogue and these exchanges, on the basis of an anual meeting, first at a local level and then extended to a European scale. Openschool.art's second edition took place in ENSAD Paris in March 2023.
