Becoming an artist or a designer in a rapidly evolving digital society
requires adaptability and a deep understanding of its dynamics. How can
we navigate a world that is strongly influenced by human actions? How do
we reinvent or preserve practices and tools that contribute to a
brighter future instead of overshadowing it? Maintaining a critical
distance while creating at the speed of the digital world is essential.
Furthermore, how do we effectively transmit our ideas amidst the
constant flux of new stimuli? These fundamental questions resonate with
many creative institutions, and openschool.art provides a unique
opportunity to address them by bringing together various art schools and
universities.

On the 10th and 11th of May 2022, approximately fifty teachers and
students from French art and design schools gathered in ESADSE\'s
auditorium to discuss the challenges involved in teaching digital
creative practices.

#### Questions we discussed together:

-   Are digital practices in art schools a game changer for the real
    world?
-   Can we teach digital practices without environmental awareness?
-   What is the common ground for a shared digital culture? or What are
    the basis of a common digital culture?
-   What are the good digital practices to share with art and design
    students?
-   Should we teach tools AND design? or Does digital design education
    go hand in hand with teaching tools?
-   Can we be a digital artist without knowing computer programming? or
    Can a digital artist be ignorant of computer programming?
-   Is digital art history a needed knowledge for a contemporary artist?
-   Does the status \"digital artist\" make sense? or Is it meaningful
    to claim to be a \"digital artist\"?
-   Does the status \"digital designer\" make sense? or Is it meaningful
    to claim to be a \"digital designer\"?
-   Does digital design involve a particular ethic?
-   In our digital society, should computer programming be a skill of
    the contemporary designer or artist\'s toolbox?
-   Does digital design facilitate inclusive design?
-   Should a digital artist or designer be self-reliant for technical
    knowledge?
-   Should a digital designer be able to design algorithms?
-   Should hacking be included in digital design education?
-   Is integrating digital into a project an ideological act?
-   Is peer-to-peer learning the most effective way to master digital
    tools?
-   Can digital design training be delegated (or outsourced) to
    tutorials?
-   Is there a minimal technical base, common to all digital creation?
-   Should art and design schools train computer programming artists or
    equipped creative individuals?
-   How does digital transforms drawing and volume teachings?
-   Regarding art and design schools, should we value computer
    programming or should we rather privilege \"no code\" environments?
-   Does using software or digital production tools (laser cutting, 3D
    printer\...) in a work make it be a digital project?
-   Can we make digital do-it-yourself practices fit into the pedagogy
    of art and design schools?
-   What position should video games have in art and design education?
-   How can we value collaborative and cooperative practices within
    digital design?
-   Are there any specificities related to digital creation?
-   What is the position of industry-derived vocabulary inside creative
    digital practices?
-   Is metaverse a place for creation?
-   Should we train artists and designers to metaverse?
-   Should digital culture and practices be connected to social
    struggles? Are they naturally linked together?
-   As new business models for creation, should NFTs be included in
    pedagogy within art and design schools?
-   Is it possible to be original and creative using proprietary
    software (Adobe, Microsoft\...)?
-   Does teaching proprietary software (Adobe, Microsoft\...) in
    creative schools produce creators or consumers?
-   Does promoting a specific \"digital writing\" in art and design make
    sense?
-   Is artificial intelligence a tool to be taught in the creative
    field?
-   Who is the author when a work is created autonomously by an
    algorithm?

### openschool.art in *Le Monde Sinon Rien* exhibition

#### Biennale Internationale Design Saint-Etienne 2022

Since our event coincided with BID Saint-Etienne, we had the opportunity
to showcase openschool.art as part of the \'Le monde, sinon rien\' (The
world or nothing) exhibition, which featured projects from students and
young researchers representing five French art and design institutions.

The \'Le monde, sinon rien\' (The world or nothing) exhibition served as
an extensive experimental platform open for public participation. Upon
entering the exhibition, visitors encountered a large floor map
representing a realm of exploration---the very landscape that art and
design school teachers offer their students each year, which they
traverse, document, and transform.

Curated by Sophie Pène (lecturer-researcher at the Learning Planet
Institute) and Benjamin Graindorge (designer and lecturer at ESADSE),
the exhibition dedicated a space to openschool.art, both physically
within the exhibition and on the website.

We decided to showcase the questions that were discussed during the
professional meetings, alongside videos that were inspired by those
questions and produced by some of the participating schools. Throughout
the entire Biennale, videos and displays were continuously added as the
ideas and discussions evolved.

The latest openschool.art session took place in Issy-les-Moulineaux,
hosted by ENSAD Paris. It served as an open forum for digital educators
from French art schools and universities to engage in discussions on a
wide range of issues. During this session, participants focused on four
main themes: "The impact of AI on art and schools," "Exploring
alternatives to Adobe: common tools for schools and resource sharing,"
and "Exploring digital tools through collective practice".

One question that remains unanswered is the role of students, which
needs to be reconsidered. In this regard, a compelling proposal would be
to consolidate the financial resources allocated to the event, allowing
for the inclusion of students with diverse profiles and backgrounds.
This approach is crucial in ensuring a diverse range of thoughts and
practices around the table.
